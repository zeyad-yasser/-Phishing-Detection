Well perhaps this little tidbit of sanity will make you (slightly) more 
gruntled:
http://www.informationwave.net/news/20020819riaa.php
----------------------------------------------------------
*IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its Network**August 19, 2002*Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the 
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the 
contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new 
plan to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of 
protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its 
customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and 
invasion of privacy to say the least.Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel 
the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after 
the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access 
and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, 
Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's 
web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the 
RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our 
customers' data.Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella 
network from its security research and development network (honeynet) 
which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the 
Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will 
take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the 
length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients 
which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt 
to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from 
Information Wave's network. The data collected will be actively 
maintained and distributed from our network operations site.The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy 
elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety 
of our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate 
espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, 
please e-mail riaa@informationwave.net .

behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing 
list.But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be 
the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get 
hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense). 
If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense). 
If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.
Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, 
not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he 
should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't 
razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.> (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).  This

open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

"it was my understanding that they had the food before they refused to pay. I often have the goods in my possession before I settle the paycheck.Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in India. It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so I'll have to watch them starve. The margin of survival is very, very, thin.So yes. In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a little food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family. That such an act triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the first shot.With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not. Nor do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors was that thin. > -----Original Message----- > From: Stephen D.

"syllable structure and gesture timing call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is "" are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable "" ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .",0
"sum : c gemination ( syntactic ) content - length : 10885 summary of data on syntactic gemination of consonants a couple of weeks ago i posted a query on what i termed "" syntactic gemination "" , for which i got information from no fewer than 15 respondents . i am very grateful to them all . here they are , listed in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondents : prathima christdas ( prathima . christdas @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca ) lance eccles ( lance . eccles @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ reading . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcia haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillips ( john @ ccyi . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) mari siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinki . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . cis . yale . edu ) the term "" syntactic gemination "" was not specific enough , as i had in mind only gemination at word boundaries , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundaries . nevertheless i will mention such cases as have been pointed out by respondents . besides , in my haste , i had forgotten to mention classical greek , which i had also taken into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here are the data : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this is the "" raddoppiamento sintattico "" of central and southern italian . nevertheless the conditions under which this appears seem to vary considerably among the dialects ( and the speakers ? ) . for instance , the example "" a casa "" [ a ' kkasa ] , taken from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) is not accepted in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these languages the definite article / ha / triggers gemination of the initial consonant of the following word ( except for certain consonants ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammars by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation is that a proto-article is reconstructed as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / has su : s / , then reinterpreted as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis has been connected with the arabic data : the final c of the article / ? al / is assimilated to the initial c of the following word ( at least for the socalled "" sun "" cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson adds this : in tunisian arabic there is a clearer case ( @ is schwa ) : shaaf - @ t 's aw - 3sf ' "" she saw "" shaaf - @ tt-u 's aw - 3sf-3sm ' "" she saw him "" the doubling is done to maintain syllable structure , but this is not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this does not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / goes to / rr - / under certain conditions after a word ending in a short final v . in epic texts , or in other dialects , this gemination is extended to other sonants : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attested in boeotian these four languages were the only instances known to me when i posted the query . incidentally , note that they are different from the cases of latin "" hic "" and "" hoc "" , which were pronounced / hikk / and / hokk / before a word beginning with a v . the form / hokk / is original ( and / hikk / analogically modelled after it ) , so that diachrony forces us to say that / hokk / is simplified into / hok / before a c - initial word . here are now the additional data kindly supplied by my respondents , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccles , siiroinen , strade ) there is consonant gemination at word boundaries in certain cases in finnish . it is morphologically conditioned though it is "" syntactic "" . several morphemes or forms trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota ' take ' / otas se ' take it ' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle ' i - give to-you ' / annan sinullek kirjan ' i - give to-you a book ' ) , most of the nouns ending in - e ( kirje ' a letter ' / kirjet tuli ' a letter arrived ' ) and so on . other examples : in some negative forms : * en mene sinne * ( i do n't go there ) , pronounced20 * en menes sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a "" la "" mene sinne * ( do n't go there ! ) , 20 pronounced : 20 * a "" la "" menes sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so called "" 1 . infinitive "" : * ha "" nen pita "" isi tulla ta "" nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta "" nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination is the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mentioned infinitive form . this consonant was assimilated to a following consonant . while it disappeared without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the following consonant was retained . this feature is n't marked in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christdas , wiltshire ) tamil has gemination of word initial stops following words with some case markings ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be found in christdas , prathima ( 1987 ) "" on constraining the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil "" in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( eds ) proceedings of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination is also found in malayalam , a closely related language . a . 8 - celtic languages ( phillips ) the celtic languages have "" mutations "" , changes to the beginnings of words due to their syntactic environment . types of mutations include prefixing of h or n to a vowel and voicing , devoicing , nasalising , etc . , of consonants . one of the mutations in old irish was gemination . the welsh spirant mutation is historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . ci "" dog "" , but tri chi "" three dogs "" , cath a chi "" a cat and a dog "" , though gemination in old irish occurred in a much wider range of environments . some of the mutations in breton are realised phonetically as gemination , though spelt otherwise . on other cases of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fulla , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agents of passive clauses ( ie . "" by "" - phrases ) are marked not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition has been ellipted ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seems to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as pointed out by nevin , in many languages , some phonotactic effects apply only in certain syntactically defined domains , for example , in roots or in verb stems , but not in affixes . hale adds that the number of languages which show this process is quite large . for instance there are some oceanic examples . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter is to be believed ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such processes . here are a few specific instances : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / is geminated to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compounds , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) has an inflectional form ( for aspect marking ) that involves deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant is geminated , or / y / is inserted an geminated if there are not the requisite number of syllables . so we have falama ` return ' becoming fallaama ` finally return ' while ala ` arrive ' becomes ayyaala ` finally arriv e ' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao is a language spoken at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebrides ) . when the direct object is incorporated in the verb , the initial c of the verb is geminated . examples , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he is fishing fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fishes fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l ' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . realis sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n 's inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa "" open o "" in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil adds this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( "" pi99el "" ) is formed by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowels . now in most part , the binyan system is considered "" derivational "" and hence not , strictly speaking , syntactic ; however , in some cases , the 2nd binyan is the "" transitive "" or "" causitive "" of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) does have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quoting verhijde : your question touches upon the fields of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination is in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there are languages that appear have morphological / syntactic triggers for c - gemination . there is a huge bulk of material on sandhi - effects , as for example the italian rs case you mentioned in your query . perhaps ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connected speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i was thinking ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination is really : share melody . or in more abstract terms : share [ x ] . if this is correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fula , southern paiute and celtic languages ) under syntactic considerations may become very interesting for you . thans again to all of you who generously answered my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )",0

composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...
In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , "" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . "" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "" great debate "" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . "" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , "" lay said . "" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . "" moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company "" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital "" and that enron "" spent too much too soon "" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.Matthias--

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for
  nontrivial apps? No way!The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try
to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't
care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix
hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you
were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't
""totally suck for nontrivial apps"".For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls
for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of
concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc
implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could
probably find much earlier references if I had time:

multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously
idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although
individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their
implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads
specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written
pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own
experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to
prefer Windows.I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading
implementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.--

arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.
Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciatedMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?Niall--

"re : transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an internal approach to internal audit dear mike , thanks for your insight . in the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with brm . through my calls the past week , i ' ve been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the enron europe work , as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative . my next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locations / commodities they ' d be best to work on . i ' ll send you an updated schedule once i ' ve finalized this . thanks shona mike jordan @ ect 10 / 11 / 2000 09 : 37 am to : shawn kilchrist / na / enron @ enron , shona wilson / na / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an internal approach to internal audit shawn / shona we have talked round this issue for some time so i thought i would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is ( we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely ) : - aims accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams . a culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive on - going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking . any independent process of review such as doorstep and brm should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it all elements of implementing , completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output we focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls ( we have defined the control structure for trading offices , agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office ) the output from enron ' s perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at control / governance meetings ( eg at sally / ted / fernley ' s level and at the audit committee level ) - the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior / experienced staff the output from aa ' s perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it trading process - monthly routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle - rating made by business controller is red , amber , green - with trend indicator of static , improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full listing monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see attachment 1 ( you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 2 - and as a senior controller i would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment ) - shona , this is the work that mike moscoso is leading periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern ( red and amber ) with agreement of action plans for such areas monthly review by controller / senior controller of database where all high ( red ) and medium ( amber ) risk issues are recorded . milestones for action plans revisited , reconfirmed or amended monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed all new information on issues raised by self assessment , doorstep review or brm completion populated into database database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original brm and doorstep plans require amendment process - yearly planning checkpoint taken of current operational environment ( say end oct ) proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office , and it development plans for next year prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to . note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern , the actions plans in place and concluding on the ' mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level ' prioritisation made for brm - which functions , not business units , require external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes ( could aa signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process ? ) - most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure management , cash management , credit exposure management , it change management controls / process where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston offsite do this ? 23 rd oct the above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week oct we agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the brm and doorstep databases - november given aa have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch - november review doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to visit all ?

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTHURSDAY, JULY 18, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

( i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down ) . parties should reconvene within 15 days after ferc ' s order adopting a model and the ferc order should direct the participants ( like us ) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter . she recommends to ferc that parties be allowed to file comments to ferc within 20 days ( however , she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process . ) the commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations , may reject her recommendations , or change something . i would expect that the commission would adopt many of her recommendations , while allowing further mediated - type discussions on some issues ( hopefully , ferc will adopt many of our suggested changes ) . judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of the grid group and the southern , etal . group , then provides the stakeholder participants ' comments ( almost verbatim from all submissions to her ) . while she states that the process should keep moving quickly , she does not adopt any timeframes ( we will comment that ferc should retain its dec 02 day 2 start date ( for lmp / financial rights congestion model to be implemented ) . the attachments below are her report , the southern , etal proposal and the grid pricing , congestion management , operating , and planning protocols ( without any changes ) . clearly , our response ferc will include our proposed changes to the documents . highlights from her report below : she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input , regardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc her opinion is that the "" grid ( entergy , gridsouth and gridflorida utility sponsored ) model "" ( transco in rto , lmp / financial rights congestion management ) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of order no . 2000 based on a "" best practices "" analysis of other rtos and commission precedent . this is good because enron generally favors the grid model . however , she does provide the commission information on southern , etal . ' s proposal ( independent system administrator - - like national grid - type ) in her report , even though she has concerns that the southern , etal model is not order no . 2000 compliant . the southern , etal . model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and lmp in real time ( with penalties ) and significant control area responsibilities . the significant aspects of the grid model are discussed below : grid governance : rto is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement : the independent market administrator ( ima ) . the ima was added to facilitate public power participation ( worried that transmission owner on top , even if divested from generation , would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution ) . the ima would administer the markets ; exercise operational authority over the transmission system ; administer one oasis ( with one process for interconnection and transmission requests ) ; and assume the security coordinator function . she strongly encourages this split . good stakeholder advisory committee ( provides majority and minority views ) and an independent market monitor to monitor the rto and the markets allows for independent transmission companies ( entergy wants to be one ) , with rto oversight describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation , such as switching transmission elements , pursuant to operating procedures approved by the rto / ima . recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as rto matures . ( protocols should be subject to further discussion ) rto / transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration , including rate changes and tariff filings all load under the rates , terms and conditions of oatt ( gridsouth group has appealed this part of earlier commission orders , and , thus , retains their rights should they win on appeal ) 4 transmission pricing zones initially : entergy , southern , gridsouth , and gridflorida . allows for participant funded , direct assigned , and merchant transmission . transmission rates to loads in rto will be zonal ( for existing facilities ) and regional charge ( for new facilities , other than those above ) . there will be one "" through and out rate "" , plus a grid management charge for rto operation . encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to oatt financial rights / lmp ( includes "" real time spot market "" ) is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model ( from pjm and spp ) - - many details need to be worked out in continued discussions . model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges ( fch ) . stakeholder process needs to be continued for fch allocation , auction and non - discriminatory release . the grid model includes a "" balancing resource "" requirement that we will provide comments against will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported - - control area operators required to provide before such market establishment rto runs single oasis and independently calculates atc and ttc rto / transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process numerous comments from marketers , ipps on reduction of control area functions ( all of our comments from last week ' s response are included ) judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners . ( 1 ) many are still concerned that ferc had not conducted a "" cost - benefit "" analysis and had concerns over the costs . she responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the "" economies of scale "" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure . in any event , ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions . ( 2 ) concerned about cost shifting : mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allowed . ( 3 ) concern that se rto would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to rto and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets . ( 4 ) concern that se rto may prematurely put southern states into retail open access ( concerns with cal . ) judge encourages the commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners . i think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "" jump start "" it gave to the se rto process due to the significant role played by judge mccartney and her team on focusing the discussions . furthermore , the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "" best practices "" pjm / spp cornerstone type real time spot energy market with lmp pricing and financial congestion hedges and an rto with an independent board structure that accommodates a for - profit rto entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process . the commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions , or , at a minimum , consider similar mediated "" jump starts .

I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.--

I just want to be sure, that forwarding an email to my own spamtrap address
which performs a razor-report on the entire received email is not waste of
time, because the contents of the forwarded email is not recognized as equal
to the email originally received. The forwarded email has a new set of
headerlines, which should be discarded and instead the headerlines of the
original message are in the body of this new message and should be recognized
as such and treated properly.An ordinary Forward Unquoted in Agent is subject to character set conversions

However, it is easy for security personnel to be overwhelmed by the sheer
volume of logs. This article will offer a brief overview of log analysis,
particularly: log transmission, log collection and log analysis. It will
also briefly touch upon log storing and archival.http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/16132.  Assessing Internet Security Risk, Part Three: an Internet Assessment
Methodology Continued
by Charl van der WaltThis article is the third in a series that is designed to help readers to
assess the risk that their Internet-connected systems are exposed to. In
the first installment, we established the reasons for doing a technical
risk assessment. In the second part, we started to discuss the methodology
that we follow in performing this kind of assessment. In this installment,
we will continue to discuss methodology, particularly visibility and
vulnerability scanning.http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/16123. Copyright, Security, and the Hollywood Hacking Bill

II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5363
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5362
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in
the OpenSSL ASN.1 library.This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,
PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed
certificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client
implementations which depend on OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369
Summary:Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in
OpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with
regards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is
possible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large
values are submitted by a malicious attacker.Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL

Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370
Summary:ParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix
and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.ParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.If a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward
buttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still
be logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A
malicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the
chat server with ""phantom"" users.  A denial of service may be the result.15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports
directory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8Note that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh
are available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following
MD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Summary:Gallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and
is available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Gallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include
arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the
following PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php
errors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php
captionator.phpAn attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on
a remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.
Reportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a
malformed email or NNTP news article.As this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may
be possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker
supplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5392
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392
Summary:Dispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and
is available for Linux and Unix operating systems.Dispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is
passed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may
exploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters
in a request to the vulnerable script.The result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell
with the privileges of the webserver process.19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5393
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393
Summary:Mailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through
a web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under
Microsoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may
be possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate
user of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or
the ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.Full exploit details are not available. It is possible that this
vulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI
parameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This
possibility has not, however, been confirmed.20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is
possible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated
directory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an
attachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the
filename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.The impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that
munpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite
any existing files.21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5351
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351
Summary:Fake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same
information to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,
and available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating
systems.Reportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long
client requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP
packets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of
arbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.Fake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been
reported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,
exploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.

I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,
but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run razor-admin -createandrazor-admin -discoverwith a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discoverhth,

Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in afamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. TheDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses.""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size upto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML.""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today.""Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the companyitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false. Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytesand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection ofXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an applicationco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch inMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.======================================================================== =DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions ofproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.======================================================================== =DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneerin XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.

Date: Not suppliedThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable:     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id=6675

"eskimo snow in context as the quotation from whorf shows , he was concerned with the issue of whether there is a general term like 's now ' in eskimo languages , not with whether eskimo ( or english ) have a multitude of specialized terms . it may be useful to point out that in the second half of the 19th century and thereafter one of the big issues concerning linguists and anthropologists was whether "" primitive "" people and their "" primitive "" languages possessed abstract terms . i think that we must view whorf 's and others ' preoccupations in this context . ( it may be of interest to add that the other great issues regarding "" primitive "" languages was whether they possess clearly defined sounds , since it was widely claimed that speakersof such languages "" alternate "" between different pronunications . it was boas who showed that this was an illusion , but i think that many people would not listen , and that works such as sapir 's paper on the sound pattenrs and even on psychological reality are largely to be understoods as attempts to defend the boas position ) . in any case , it should be clear that the issue was never how many words a language might have for specific kinds of anything , but whether it has words for the general types or kinds . and in this context the only question is whether the eskimo languages have one word for 's now ' like english or two like ancient greek or whether they only have a variety of more particular words for kinds of snow . alexis",0

Date: Not suppliedJanis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented 
science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry.     Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - 
    not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux 
    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy 
    saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is 
    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. 
    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the 
    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market 
    consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less 
    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because 
    that's all you'll be able to find out there.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/23/133228

"re : sharad update hi kate , firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him . sharad seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected . he asked me some questions about the "" bonus culture "" at enron and suggested that it was not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with . i sold him on the value he can extract from the excellence within the research group and the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in , but he still seemed reticent saying that he "" needs time "" which i understood to mean that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere . he is a great candidate and it would be a real shame to lose him , given the difficulty of getting good candidates . i discussed this with vince and given how much we need him in research in london and vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee or sign on to help him make the right decision . i think vince will call you or dale to discuss this . regards , anjam tel : 713 345 9991 [ p . s . vince , kate bruges is on extension 37354 , dale is on 36726 ] kate bruges 13 / 07 / 2000 11 : 02 to : anjam ahmad / lon / ect @ ect cc : subject : sharad hi anjam how did your conversation go yesterday ? regards kate",0

list a little while ago.
It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.
LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)Justin

"mark - to - market bob , i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you about on the phone . i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the transaction to you . krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here . he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market . please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through mauritius , and then caymen islands . another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f and other concerns ) . finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about , and will brief you on the same . krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here . look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting project for us all . regards , sandeep .",0
"re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 ted , question 1 ) the investments in calme and apachi are booked on an accrual basis . i have had several meetings with commercial and accounting representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are effectively reinvested back into the assets . therefore , the market values that are reflected on the mpr are actually book values . the book values are typically adjusted the last week of the month and are 1 month behind as the internation groups wait until the gl is closed before communicating the updated values . question 2 ) thanks for the heads - up on india . i spoke with sheila glover and we are now aware of the details behind rediff . com . we need to ensure that these positions are not accounted for on the dpr by india so that we do not double - report the p & l . the long - term solution is to establish a communication line for future investments . between sheila , donna lowry , and i we can develop a plan . question 3 ) the 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by jeff kinneman for jim easter . during our last conversation , jim told jeff that these are strategic investments and should not be reflected on the mpr . there is still some uncertainty / confusion as to when an investment is classified as merchant . we could insist that all publically traded investments not included in the equity books would qualify . having said that , i would like to know if the gas authority of india , ltd ( gail ) and europe ' s investment in mg are considered to be merchant investments . i will be on vacation this friday and all of next week so please include david maxwell on any responses . david and i will stay in touch so as to make adjustments as needed . thanks , todd from : ted murphy 06 / 22 / 2000 03 : 07 pm to : d todd hall / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy subject : re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 mr . hall , i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for 6 / 20 and have the following questions : 1 ) calme shows an asset of $ 291 . 9 mm and apachi shows an asset of $ 113 . 0 mm and they show no p & l for the year is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums and commodity prices ? 2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) . where does this show up ? 3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities that i do not believe are on the dpr . shouldn ' t they be ? and if so , who is deciding not to include ? pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do . thanks ted from : d todd hall 06 / 21 / 2000 01 : 16 pm to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , andrea v reed / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , carol jean marshall / hou / ect @ ect , raymond bowen / hou / ect @ ect , jeff skilling / corp / enron @ enron , jeff donahue / hou / ect @ ect , l ' sheryl hudson / hou / ect @ ect , monica reasoner / hou / ect @ ect , hope vargas / hou / ect @ ect , adarsh vakharia / hou / ect @ ect , joseph w sutton @ enron , michael s galvan / hou / ect @ ect , maria lebeau / hou / ect @ ect , wes colwell / hou / ect @ ect , mark frevert / na / enron @ enron , thomas myers / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00",0

"Ananova:Â  
Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.

To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. 
I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing 
quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double 
album this year and have been touring in support of that release. 
For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is 
awesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the 
Treo 270, but for what I'll need, 
this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that 
remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's 
use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. I'm also scoping out the 
Palm Markup Language 
(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, 
in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of 
the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content 
organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add 
some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and 
anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

TomeRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25
http://www.tomeraider.com/
Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my 
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy 
to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, 
allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) 
with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. 
The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in 
mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a 
modified set of HTML tags with the  designation for page breaks. The 
only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre 
in the software.Â GnomeFEATURE

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, 
but he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In 
this segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for 
Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, 
you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary 
to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners 
throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary 
pieces with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some 
beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A 
Netherlands native,  who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests 
(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American 
jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native 
English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so 
you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but 
for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a 
fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen  van den Hombergh's talent. A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about

Click for DetailsThe Man Who Wasn't There (R) 2001
Drama - 116min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers CommentaryMuch more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate.

bc hydro readies itself for transmission line sale ? bpa aborts additional rate increase , refutes california ' s overcharge claims bc government the bc liberals have announced that they are putting together a new policy task force on energy to deal with energy issues going forward . they will be looking at the province ' s energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward . the task force includes : jack ebbels , deputy minister of the ministry of energy and mines , chair peter meekison , energy policy consultant john bechtold , oil and gas expert erik westergaard , hydroelectricity expert brenda eaton , deputy minister to the premier our information is that the policy task force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process . additionally , the canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19 . 4 % us tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the states . a bc cabinet minister has made veiled threats to tie canadian energy exports to the united states to eliminating the softwood timber tariff . jean chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks , but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in northern bc along . bc hydro bc hydro chair larry bell is soft - peddling the bc liberals ' message of deregulation . coming under intense scrutiny , bell has already gone public to defend bc hydro ' s rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and powerex operations will not be deregulated . we noticed , however , that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth . we believe that bc hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short - to - medium term . two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are : trans - elect corporation , which has indicated it is watching the british columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in calgary ; and transconnect , which has been working with the rto - west group , which could eventually plug bc hydro ' s transmission systems into the rto west grid . bell has been talking about instituting a tiered - rate plan for bc ' s own energy - intensive industries , allowing energy - efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate , increasing rates for others . he is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in bc . however , bell has not been as hot on "" clean coal "" generation as neufeld , having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology , which has been economically and environmentally sound . strategically , hydro ' s export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border . from what we are seeing of the new chairman ' s position , it appears that bc hydro will attempt to sever the "" feeling of entitlement "" that bc ' s own energy - intensive industries have relied on . that is , hydro is snooping around the states for greener pastures after having had a taste of the california windfall last year . why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere ? bpa financial conditions to everyone ' s relief , bpa last week announced there would be no additional rate increase . in early august the agency had warned that its pre - third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial - based cost recovery adjustment clause ( fb crac ) , one of three cracs bpa and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices . the load - based ( lb ) crac has already driven a 46 percent rate increase , and the fb crac could have added another 4 . 5 mills . but the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger , so there will be no additional rate hike . additionally , we have also heard that bpa is still committed to spending roughly $ 186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues . ferc refunds although bpa has not issued an official statement , as a net supplier to california it is likely that bpa would be opposed to california ' s attempt to recoup over $ 1 . 5 billion in perceived overcharges from the pacific northwest . earlier this year , bpa responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled "" bpa response to california iso study "" on 13 april 2001 which maintained that its operations were above reproach . bpa will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from cal - iso ' s allegations . pacific northwest utilities and other energy - using entities , such as the city of tacoma and the port of seattle , also have joined in the fray to pursue $ 2 billion in perceived overcharges . the name of the game on the west coast is to say that you were a net importer , not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by ferc and the federal judge . everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers , not sellers . spill issues the power planning council has recommended spending more than $ 7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year . most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the john day river in oregon , with $ 1 . 6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the yakima river . the $ 7 million is in addition to $ 24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main - stem dams . bpa had agreed to fund $ 9 . 3 million worth of the council ' s list . other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the south fork of idaho ' s clearwater river , spending $ 300 , 000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of oregon ' s umatilla river , and installing stream flow gauges in the entiat , okanogan and wenatchee rivers .",0

  | Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
  | think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
  | stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
  | immediately obvious to everyone. maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,
 or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines
 that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company! there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link. I use this fact on occasion to ""save"" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 ""temporary"" file does not destroy the data.
 
cheers!

but there are no real outlets for the plain presentation and discussion of * data * . this meeting will consist of two elements : a . a collection of data , printed as an issue in the society 's occasional series , _ the yuen ren society treasury of chinese dialect data _ , and b . a presentation of the data by the fieldworker or compiler , together with discussion by the audience . the _ treasury _ will be available at the meeting , where it will serve as the handout . ii . deadlines . 28 january 1995 , for submission of an abstract and either a full-length draft of the material or a reasonably long sample from it . 28 february 1995 , for receipt by the society of the final camera-ready draft . this deadline is firm ; if you are afraid you are going to miss it , you should be in touch with the society * before * that happens . there is no deadline for registration at the conference , but we would like to know beforehand if you plan to attend . iii . submission of material . anyone wishing to present data at the society 's conference must submit it for publication in the _ yuen ren treasury of chinese dialect data _ . all submissions will be subject to review . if you cannot be present at the conference , you may still submit material to the current issue of the _ treasury _ . this conference is independent of the american oriental society meeting . there is no fee for the yuen ren society meeting , but it is the responsibility of everyone who attends to pay any aos registration fees that may be required of them . iv . attendance by non-participants . the conference is open to everyone , including people who are not members of the yuen ren society . there will be no fee for attending the conference , but there may be a small on-site registration fee for anyone who wants a copy of the _ yuen ren treasury _ . the _ treasury _ will serve as the combined handout for the whole conference . v . notes on style and format . 1 . the society favors the use of gwoyeu romatzyh , but will not reject any other reasonable system of romanization , as long as all tonal distinctions are represented in some consistent way . papers that use romanization without some form of tonal distinction will be rejected . both traditional and simplified characters are welcome . 2 . the languages of the conference and of all papers should be english or mandarin . 3 . length of individual presentations at the conference will be variable , with up to 25 minutes per presentation , and discussion ad hoc . please tell the society how long your presentation will be . length of documents in the _ treasury _ will also be variable , depending on their contents . 4 . all papers should include a section in the bibliography entitled "" sources of dialect data "" or something comparable , in addition to the ordinary list of works cited . papers introducing data from original fieldwork * must * list the names of all sites represented , together with information about the informants used and the dates of fieldwork . papers using any data not gathered by the author personally * must * list the sources of each distinct set of data . it is a good idea to distinguish different sources , even if they represent the same site . 5 . all submissions to the _ yuen ren treasury _ must be made in camera-ready hard copy . handwritten documents , unless they are remarkably neat , will ordinarily be rejected . for documents produced on a computer , common serif fonts such as courier or new york should be used for roman letter writing apart from ipa , and a sharply legible bitmap or outline font such as sung should be used for kanji . very neatly handwritten kanji are acceptable . if in doubt , send a sample of your typefaces to the society * before * the submission deadline . 6 . finished documents should have margins a minimum of one inch wide . print should be black only , and the body of the text should be between 12 and 14 point in size and double spaced . documents produced on a computer should be printed at not less than 300 dpi . 7 . in general , papers should follow the style guidelines of a recent edition of the _ chicago manual of style _ . vi . restrictions : barring exceptional circumstances , the following will be considered outside the scope of the conference , since there are already other outlets for them : 1 . papers emphasizing formal analysis or formal representation . 2 . new romanization schemes . 3 . papers comparing a single modern dialect to the jin ' in ( a . k . a . _ chiehyunn _ ) phonological system . 4 . papers all of whose data is culled from published sources , unless the source is rare or for some reason poorly known . 5 . studies of "" mandarin "" , "" taiwanese "" , "" cantonese "" , "" hakka "" , or other standard dialects , based neither on fieldwork nor the speech of named sites or sources . 6 . presentations that do not consist primarily of data .",0

open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

"ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . "" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . "" given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted .",0
"sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",0
"3 . 417 citations i can't resist putting in my tuppence worth on chomsky 's citation record . here are my very informal observations of how he is treated by non ( theoretical ) linguists . ( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor 's much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c 's theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c 's views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in "" the mind 's new science "" , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in "" aspects "" and in the non-technical parts of "" knowledge of language "" . it 's surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into "" government and binding "" . - philip swann",0

"fw : a positive note about enron . move over carly fiorina . . . : - ) - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jaffry , adil sent : thursday , october 04 , 2001 9 : 32 am to : jafry , rahil subject : fw : a positive note about enron . fyi . . . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : attacks highlight enron ' s value by lisa sanders 3 : 02 am et oct 4 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by enron . the attacks highlighted the houston company ' s strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty . through its trading centers , the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil , natural gas , and electricity markets , as well as other commodities . although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks , its trading activity resumed the next day . by coming back online so fast , "" we made the decision to provide some stability in the market , "" said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . "" the customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . "" in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken . nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center . "" we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way , "" meyer said "" we also had traders who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the planes hit . "" the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks "" may have increased volatility , a boon to the group , "" said bob christensen , analyst at fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said . managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said . "" the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , "" said glen hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new power fund , which has a stake in enron . "" with energy risk and prices potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed dial . "" other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume . high profile departure that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly . john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy and power technology fund , said he "" freaked out "" when skilling left and managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s . "" this is a premier company and a premier industry , "" he said , adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock . one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said . that has not materialized . whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true . "" in our experience , when somebody in power leaves for no reason , there ' s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous , "" he said . management continuity now he ' s looking to get back in . enron , he said , works in both down and up markets . "" enron ' s earnings are more solid today than they ' ve ever been . . . and they ' re valuable because we ' re becoming a digital economy , "" he said . "" we need high - quality power , and local power plants have trouble providing reliability . enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system . "" of course there ' s still the issue about trusting management . after skilling left , enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief operating officer and mark frevert to vice chairman . "" you cannot expect ( whalley and frevert ) to articulate the enron vision the way jeffrey did , "" christensen said . "" they may grow into it . "" on the upside , skilling predecessor ken lay , who wall street credits with building enron into a powerhouse , is back at the helm , and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place . "" we have a great deal of confidence in mr . ken lay as he was the original architect of ene ' s ( and for that matter the entire industry ' s ) tremendous transformation for the past decade , "" merrill lynch stated in a research report the day after skilling left enron . what ' s more : "" ken lay has promised more transparency at enron , more insight into how the company makes money , which will help , "" hilton said . "" trying to forecast enron ' s earnings is difficult . "" christensen said that a "" lack of data and clarity in regard "" to enron ' s wholesale operations has been an issue in the past . enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its third - quarter results on october 16 . ultimately , only time will assuage investors ' concerns . but with the prospects that enron has , the stock is a deal right now , hammerschmidt said . "" i don ' t know what gets people back , but buy enron at $ 25 , and in a year , you ' re making money , "" he said . "" i can see the stock getting back to $ 50 in a blink . """,0

spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set
to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score

corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of
*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing
only tests that are expensive for their utility.Unfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.--

"the "" black hole "" of pre - chomskyan citations steve anderson 's new book on morphology should contain the follow - ing epigraph ( if he did n't change it before publication ) : "" linguistics will become a science when linguists begin standing on one another 's shoulders instead of one another 's toes "" . i think he has a point . we have reached the point where we are redoing some aspects of language more poorly than they were done the first time . the problem may have originated from the fact that little had been done in syntax prior to the work of the generative school ; little , that is , in comparison to what has been done since the instigation of that movement . jakobson 's and halle 's work in distinctive features also clearly superceded pre - vious work , making it difficult to find structuralist work relevant to what is going on today . however , anderson is right in chiding us for carrying this attitude over to morphology , where the current trend in and around massachusetts has hardly moved beyond bloomfield , the first to claim that affixes are regular lexical items . first rate morphologi - cal study goes back to the stoic philosophers , who were the first to tease apart grammatical categories and , on a different track , back to panini . not only is most current morphology failing to cite relevant sources , it is failing to take advantage of the discoveries of struc - turalist , neogrammarian , and even classical morphologists . these pre - decessors were particularly adept at finding problems in the theory of the linguistic sign . varro ( 47-45 ) was the first to attempt to define lexical categories in terms of [ + / - n , + / - v ] as well as lexicalizations . aristotle noticed that grammatical morphemes differed from lexical ones and the stoics first used the terms "" signifier "" and "" signified "" . i am jumping into the middle of this discussion but i think mark has touched the real issue : it is less that chomsky and other members of his school are quoted so much than that many others who make contri - butions - - often the same ones - - are quoted to little . the result which i am seeing more and more often is the second , third , fourth reinvention of the wheel . - - rbeard",0

856-4186 to communicate your problem . driving : if you arrive by car from the north or east , exit i-465 ( the circle road around indianapolis ) onto highway 67 at the sw corner of the city , and head south about 45 miles ; turn south ( left ) only highway 231 about 10 miles north of spenser , and at the first stoplight in spenser ( one of only three ! ) turn left ( east ) onto highway 46 . go two miles , then turn left into the park at a well-marked entrance . at the gate , state that your are arriving for the slavic workshop , and they will admit you without the $ 2 admission charge ) . the canyon inn is about 1 km into the park along the main road , and it is well marked . if you arrive from the south , take i-65 to highway 46 at columbus , indiana . exit west ( left ) and travel 50-60 miles through bloomington to the park , which will be on the right just before spenser . > from the west , take i-70 towards indianapolis , and exit onto highway 231 . travel about 30 miles south to spenser , then follow the directions above . > from bloomington , spenser is 15 miles to the west along highway 46 ( drive west on 17th st , which becomes 46 as it leaves bloomington ) . email me if you require additional transportation information ! accommodations the workshop will be held at the canyon inn on the territory of mccormick 's creek state park . two types of rooms are available : 1 double bed ( $ 60 / night ) 2 single beds ( $ 60 / night as single , $ 30 / person / night as double ) the rooms are small but quite nice , all with air conditioning , private bath , color tv , and the usual furnishings . we have contracted to pay the inn directly for our block of rooms ( thus saving all taxes , since we are a tax-exempt organization ! ) , and therefore you should make reservations with us via email , fax , etc . , and plan to pay us for your room upon arrival at the workshop . we prefer checks , if possible , but will take cash happily and can take credit cards if there is no other alternative ( we will have to handle this through slavica , as if you were purchasing books instead of paying for the room ) . the canyon inn has a swimming pool , and various outdoor recreation facilities are available ( hiking through the woods , horseback riding for a fee , etc . ) , so pack accordingly if you plan to take advantage of these opportunities during the workshop ! expect hot and humid weather , with daily temperatures reaching or exceeding 30 degrees celsius . overflow rooms are available at the patriot inn , about 1 km from the park entrance . these rooms cost about $ 44 single plus $ 4 - 5 per additional person in room . they are not as nice as the canyon inn rooms , and staying away from the workshop diminishes the coziness of the workshop experience , so we will not use them unless we run out of space at the canyon inn ( and this does not appear to be a problem at the moment ) . if you have to stay there , we will provide transportation to and from the conference site . if you want to stay in bloomington for a few days before or after the workshop , we have blocked some rooms in eigenmann hall , a graduate dormitory with single rooms , on-premises cafeteria , and within walking distance of our library . rooms cost about $ 28 / day ( food is not included ) , and may be paid for by credit card , cash , or checks . you should request these rooms through me in advance of the workshop , specifying arrival and departure dates . food the conference will provide the following meals at no charge to participants ( if you are accompanied by a spouse or children , they are welcome to join us but you must pay for their food ; email me for details ) . it is very important that i have an exact count before the conference , as i must provide this information to the canyon inn , so please keep me informed of your plans friday evening : outdoor picnic dinner ( barbecue chicken and ribs , various other dishes ; vegetarians can feast on salads etc . ; indoors if it rains ) saturday morning : coffee / juice / pastries / fruit at the conference room saturday lunch : buffet with sandwiches , salads , beverages , etc . sunday morning : same as saturday morning . saturday evening and sunday lunch are not provided for . i figure many people might want to go to a restaurant in bloomington , but there is a decent restaurant in the canyon inn as well , and one pleasant-looking hilltop restaurant in spenser as well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * george fowler [ email ] gfowler @ indiana . edu dept . of slavic languages [ dept . tel . ] 1-812 -

> Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
there be three pairings which result in each person
having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are:
 - above the single partner threshold
 - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
 - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
 - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more 
""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
defined uselessly.- Gordon

"summary : polish phonology not too long ago i posted a request for polish informants who were also linguists in the hope of getting some quick responses to some questions about polish phonology which are not fully addressed in the literature . the response has been tremendous . since the details may not be of interest , and since i am not sure if all respondents want their names used , i will summarize as follows : most respondents report having a contrast between the sequences [ k ' e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g ' e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k ' ] and [ g ' ] i mean a fronted velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondents report no contrast , which is apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spreading sound change . of those speakers who do have the contrast , most report also having a similar contrast between [ x ' e ] and [ xje ] sequences , although one or two do not . it is this last contrast , [ x ' e ] vs . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people 's names i will post a "" nonymous "" acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr",0

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
Date: Not suppliedFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""
*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html

commercial advertising, we need email software that

simply can't continue down the path where every
script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
damage.(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
point that digital signatures are the standard way
to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
your machine or otherwise compromising your private
key will be the only way that someone can forge a
message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.

hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at

"Mike,i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'.rgds, rob -----Original Message----- From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM To: Rob Shavell Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??

I *do* care about content. Hell, if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, I'd have a different opinion of this. I just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not).While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?I don't buy it.For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not nearly as often as words. Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games? Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across.>misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same >thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better >resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant >had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, >and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of >decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the >photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, SMS >didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its >greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS >traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, >SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). I wasn't saying that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"".I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. Sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum.I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. People want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. That's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. The instant view part. I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". Which is what this service offers. I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". I think people like to package their pictures and show them. That's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. I still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method.What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it.I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there.Willing to be proven wrong, MikePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

Forwarded-by: ""Dave Bruce"" 
Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

Net Neutrality and the eBay Community: A Call to Action
========================================================

Dear jnazario,

As you know, I almost never reach out to you personally with a request to get involved in a debate in the U.S. Congress. However, today I feel I must.

Right now, the telephone and cable companies in control of Internet access are trying to use their enormous political muscle to dramatically change the Internet. It might be hard to believe, but lawmakers in Washington are seriously debating whether consumers should be free to use the Internet as they want in the future.

Join me by clicking here -- http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092 -- to send a message to your representatives in Congress.

The phone and cable companies now control more than 95% of all Internet access. These large corporations are spending millions of dollars to promote legislation that would allow them to divide the Internet into a two-tiered system.

The top tier would be a ""Pay-to-Play"" high-speed toll-road restricted to only the largest companies that can afford to pay high fees for preferential access to the Net.

The bottom tier -- the slow lane -- would be what is left for everyone else. If the fast lane is the information ""super-highway,"" the slow lane will operate more like a dirt road.

Today's Internet is an incredible open marketplace for goods, services, information and ideas. We can't give that up. A two-lane system will restrict innovation because start-ups and small companies -- the companies that can't afford the high fees -- will be unable to succeed, and we'll lose out on the jobs, creativity and inspiration that come with them.

The power belongs with Internet users, not the big phone and cable companies. Let's use that power to send as many messages as possible to our elected officials in Washington. Please join me by clicking here right now to send a message to your representatives in Congress before it is too late. You can make the difference.

"" the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , "" parker said . "" i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . "" enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . "" what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , "" reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . "" what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , "" reck said . "" so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . "" enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . "" we are kind of commodity - agnostic , "" reck explained . "" we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . "" enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that . "" we have done that in every market we have gotten into , "" reck said . "" what we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time . you have to show what the benefits are . "" jocoo 000 .

Software contracts: Clause for alarmIn the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's 
the language in the contracts. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of 
multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and mind-boggling 
license conversions. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just 
ask California.

"query : pseudo - explanations i am trying to collect examples of pseudo-explanations of linguistic phenomena which invoke supposed beliefs or customs such as the following : ( a ) hopi pluralizes the word for ' cloud ' the way that it usually pluralizes only animate nouns , so whorf claimed that this proves that the hopis believe clouds to be alive , ( b ) malagasy and some other languages tend to use passive rather than active voice forms in imperatives , so it is has often been claimed ( i even did this myself once ) that this is a matter of politeness , because by using a passive you are avoiding actually ordering the addressing around , while still making it clear what you want done . ( c ) one of the languages of the torres straits uses the dual in speaking to a married woman , and this was explained by saying that a married woman was assumed to have a child with her ! ! ! ( d ) there is even the famous case of a russian work which claimed that the adjective * beremennyj * ' pregnant ' had no masculine forms ( like the one i just cited ) because only females can get pregnant and then used this very form , saying that a "" beremennyj muzhchina "" ( = "" pregnant - masc man "" ) is inconceivable ! these are the kinds of things i would like to collect . and it would be especially if there were a case where the explanation was valid and not pseudo , of course , please send the examples to me and i will post a summary .",0

"" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called "" structured finance arrangement . "" the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : "" in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . "" according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : "" at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . "" the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been "" in the money "" , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .",0

Date: Not suppliedI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.[1] http://www.parentstv.org/

"sum : object affixes dear linguists the time has come for me to post a summary based on replies to a query i posted a few weeks ago . this summary is rather long , and has the following structure : 1 ) the original query 2 ) acknowledgement of respondents 3 ) discussion of a few languages 4 ) general discussion 5 ) refs 6 ) outline of relevant details of roviana 7 ) summary 1 ) the query ) i am studying roviana , a western oceanic lg . there are pronominal object ) suffixes which occur on the verb indexing person , number etc . however , ) there are no affixes on the verb which would correspond to 's ubject ' ) ( however we might construe the concept ) . dixon ( 1994 ) claims that there ) are no lgs with object affixes but which lack subject affixes . does ) anybody else know of any other counter-examples ? 2 ) acknowledgements . my thanks to the following people ( listed in no particular order ) for their responses ( and my apologies if i have left anyone out ) : matthew dryer , karen wallace , mark campana , eloise jelinek , leo connolly , geoffrey nathan , johannes heinecke , malcolm ross , mark mandel , jaejung song . first , a point of clarification . by western oceanic i mean a branch of eastern austronesian . some of the replies seemed to indicate that people interpreted it to mean western austronesian . ( not that it is really important ) . some people replied with examples of languages with object affixes , whether or not the languages in question also had affixes indicating other grammatical relations . matthew dryer replied with the following list of languages which have object affixes but no subject affixes ( taken from an a database mentioned by him in language 1992 ) : africa : central khoisan ( nama ) , ijoid ( kolokuma ijo ) , gur ( bimoba ) , east chadic ( kera ) , biu-mandara ( margi , mbara ) , west chadic ( ngizim ) . eurasia : nax ( ingush ) , avaro-andi - dido ( avar ) , lezgic ( archi ) , munda ( mundari ) . se asia oceania : nicobarese ( car nicobarese ) , central-eastern malayo-polynesian ( kiribatese , ponapean , woleaian ) . north america : pimic ( papago ) . south america : warao , maipurean ( palikur ) . i have not been able to follow up on all of these refs . i have however , looked at the micronesian languages . 3 ) discussion of a few languages sohn ( 1975 ) re woleaian : object suffixes , but no affixes corresponding to any other grammatical relation . 3sg has three forms : zero and - y / - w . it seems that verbs fall in to two classes , with zero being added to verbs in one class ( many of whose members appear to have a tr suffix ) and - y / - w to members of the other class ( the choice in forms being phonologically conditioned ) . interestingly , 3pl distinguishes animate vs inanimate , whereas all other persons and numbers do not . these affixes can occur with or without an overt independent object np . these affixes occur on certain post-verbal advbs , suggesting that they might in fact be clitics . zewen ( 1977 ) re marshallese . pronominal objects immediately follow the verb . 3sg and 3pl are enclitics and undergo vowel harmony . these enclitics can co-occur with lexical np object . ' subject ' prons are all independent . groves , groves and jacobs ( 1985 ) re kiribatese . it seems from their description that the language has object suffixes but no other affixes indicating grammatical relations . however , there are things which could perhaps be analyzed as subject prefixes ( p1 08 ) . exactly which object suffixes get attached ( out of 11 classes ) seems to be lexically determined . 4 ) general discussion it would appear that there are no cross-linguistic studies of object affixes per se . some respondents questioned whether the object suffixes in roviana are really suffixes and not just clitics . they are suffixes , but even if they were n't the focus of my interest would be the same . i am focussing on two facts about roviana : ( a ) the case marking on np 's is on an ergative-absolutive basis , but the only grammatical relation indicated by verbal affixes is object . ( b ) of the object affixes , only 3pl has zero form . being functionally inclined , i am interested in finding a motivation for ( b ) . it is not simply a case of referentiality ( see the brief sketch below ) . 5 ) refs ( with diacritics mangled by the internet ) corston , simon h . 1993 . ergativity in roviana . ma thesis : auckland university , new zealand .

' ( animals , 034 ) ( the paper i am writing now clarifies why i only put erg in parentheses - it is really unmarked , and you have to infer in this context that the pron = erg because there is no particle ) kote arina tie mae magu-i - 0 sarini fut pl man come carve - tr-3pl . do 3pl . abs ' the men will come and carve them up . ' ( feast , 016 ) ( them = pigs in a feast ) nb , here the do is the pron sarini . however , you can get the affixes even if there is no overt do np , suggesting that they have independent reference , e . g . ai lul-i - u mo intj follow - tr-1sg . do dt ' hey ! follow me . ' ( animals , 011 ) and the following longer example . e saimone sa tie he-hegere hoirana . pers simon def man dup - laugh there ' that 's simon , the man who 's laughing over there . ' avos-i - a xoi ? hear - tr-3sg . do you ( erg ) ' do you hear him ? ' ( day , 029-030 ) note that the suffixes do not ' index ' absolutive etc , only o . ( see ma ) roviana has case marked and quantified np 's . case ( erg , abs , obl , etc ) is indicated by articles before the np . quantifiers ( numbers , 's ome ' , ' all ' etc ) precede the head n . non - specific undergoers obligatorily occur in a backgrounded object construction . compare the following two examples . raro talo si gami cook taro abs 1pl . excl ' we cooked taro ' / ' we did some taro cooking ' it is difficult to say if ' talo ' is ' incorporated ' since there are no other indep elements assoc with the verb which ever come after . note that the backgrounded constr is intr , with no transitive marking , and with the actor as s . compare to the ' usual ' order vao raro-a gami sa talo cook - 3sg . do 1pl . excl def taro ' we cooked the taro . ' undergoers which are pragmatically backgrounded can also occur in the backgrounded object construction , irrespective of whether they are referential or not . 7 ) summary * languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . * i feel that having 3pl as the only zero form is unusual , but am unable to find a cross-linguistic study to bear this out . even so , the zero form requires a functional explanation ( cf du bois , john w . 1987 ' absolutive zero : paradigm adaptivity in sacapultec maya ' , lingua 71 : 203-222 ) . again , my thanks to those who replied . ps i should have a draft of my paper ' featuredness and core arguments in roviana ' available shortly . simon corston corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu",0

Microsoft will continue to build in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a network manager with a central database to store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

Pittman set to leave AOL Time WarnerAOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the company.
Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be based on his own decision, the source added. AOL Time Warner last week confirmed that it hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to head AOL's CEO search.

"I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.Thanks,	David.David Hamilton

it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
more formal.
------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

"subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol",0

"k . polgardi , vowel harmony vowel harmony . an account in terms of governement and optimality by krisztina polgardi vowel harmony deals with some theoretical problems concerning the phenomenon of vowel harmony , in a framework combining insights from government phonology , optimality theory and lexical phonology . the study introduces and motivates the general framework and examines three issues . the first concerns the typology of vowel harmony systems and how an element-based feature theory , comprised of the three elements i , a and u and supplemented by the property of headedness , can account for all the different types of harmony . the second concerns the domain of harmony and the question of how to handle disharmonicity in the proposed model . the third involves the so-called neutral vowels , i . e . those vowels in a system that do not have a harmonic counterpart . it is claimed that the behaviour of neutral vowels can be predicted from their segmental make-up and from particular properties of the vowel systems involved . polgrdi argues that the theory of government phonology ( a principles-and - parameters approach ) needs to be supplemented by constraint ranking , because certain types of phenomena cannot be accounted for otherwise . since ranking is shown to be necessary , language variation can now be exclusively expressed by this device , and the notion of param - eters can be abandoned . polgrdi also argues that a non-derivational version of the strict cycle condition also needs to be incorporated into the theory to account for so-called derived environment effects ( of which disharmonicity is shown to be an example ) . 1998 . xii + 200 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 046 - 5 . paperback . lot interna - tional series 3 . hil / leiden university dissertation . price for individuals ordering directly from the publisher : nlg 36 , 90 , excl . vat and p&p . holland academic graphics , the hague < http : / / www . hag . nl > rint sybesma holland academic graphics po box 53292 2505 ag the hague the netherlands fax : + 31 70 448 0177",0

"review : torrego , the dependencies of objects . torrego , esther , ( 1998 ) , the dependencies of objects . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 . cambridge , massachusetts : the mit press . 197 pages . reviewed by alex alsina , universitat pompeu fabra ( barcelona ) . this book is a study of overtly case-marked objects in spanish that pays attention to similar phenomena in other languages , particularly other romance languages . it is well-known that direct objects , or accusative objects , in spanish , when expressed as full nps , or dps ( to use the author 's term ) , alternate between two forms depending on various semantic and syntactic properties : dps withouth any overt case morphology , and overtly case-marked dps . the overt case marker in question is the preposition "" a "" , which also marks dative objects . the study adopts the minimalist program , outlined by chomsky ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) , as a framework for developing an analysis for the various phenomena under investigation . synopsis chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework of the book and sketches the content of the subsequent chapters . chapter 2 presents the various generalizations that characterize spanish accusative objects marked by the dative preposition . among these generalizations are correlations between overt case-marking and specificity , between overt case-marking and telicity , between overt case-marking and an interpretation of the subject as an agent or a cause , etc . the common element in the explanation of all of these generalizations is the idea that the marked accusative object raises overtly to a position outside vp , to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes the vp as its complement . for example , the two following facts are observed : marked accusative requires ( or may require ) a telic interpretation of the event which is absent with unmarked accusative objects , and an affected interpretation of the ( animate ) object requires overt case-marking on the object . it is suggested that objects moved outside the vp have a delimiting role for their predicates and , at the same time , the position to which objects moved , the spec of vp , is the locus of affectedness . thus , two different properties of overt case-marking would be made to follow from the idea that overtly case-marked objects in spanish undergo overt movement to spec of vp . likewise , the observation that overt case-marking on the object requires the subject to be interpreted as an agent or as a cause is linked to the idea that an overtly case-marked object is in spec-v p and to the hypothesis that the causative or agent role is assigned to the v - vp configuration . torrego proposes that there are two types of marked accusatives , one with structural case and the other with inherent case . marked accusative is inherent with causative and agentive verbs and those with affected objects , and is structural with other verbs . this theoretical difference is appealed to in order to account for an asymmetry with respect to extraction out of marked accusative objects : such extractions are ill-formed with the former class of verbs , but not with the latter . the presence of the extra structure created by the inherent case marker is a crucial element in the explanation of this contrast . chapter 3 examines variation in causative structures in spanish and argues that this variation is largely conditioned by case assignment . much of the discussion is based on a causative structure in which the causee appears between the causative verb "" hacer "" ' make ' and the infinitive . one of the goals of the chapter is to explain the restrictions on the "" faire-par "" causative in several spanish dialects . in these dialects , the "" faire-par "" causative is only fully acceptable in the following situations : ( 1 ) when an object clitic is present , or ( 2 ) when a reflexive clitic is present , and that , otherwise they are best with verbs identified as "" constructive accomplishments "" such as ' build ' or with case-marked objects . chapter 4 analyzes constructions with dative objects , both with ditransitive verbs and with unaccusatives . restrictions regarding constructions with two objects with identical case-marking are examined . the chapter also deals with contrasts between the presence and absence of doubling clitics . a comparison is made with the double object constructions in english . an analysis is presented of the contrast in raising constructions with 's eem ' between those without the dative argument ( acceptable ) and those with it ( unacceptable ) . conclusions are briefly summarized at the end . critical discussion this book is a mine of linguistic puzzles concerning objects , causative constructions , clitics , and related phenomena in spanish . it is of interest to anyone concerned with these matters , regardless of what analysis and what theoretical framework one may wish to adopt . this book is also of interest to linguists who want to find out how the minimalist program can be applied to a particular empirical domain . the author has done a great job of synthesizing the data and presenting generalizations that need to be explained . despite these positive aspects of the book , i experienced serious frustrations while reading it having to do with the data and with the analysis . data the problem with the data , which is a minor one compared to the other one , has to do with the fact that many of the data presented are alien to the varieties of spanish that i speak or am familiar with . naturally , i cannot claim to know all varieties of spanish , so i should not be surprised to discover data that do not belong to the spanish that i know . some examples follow . torrego presents a contrast in pp . 58-59 between "" a quienes ( les ) vieron ? "" and "" a quienes ( * los ) vieron ? "" , but both forms are equally ill-formed for me when the clitic ( the form in parentheses ) is included . the example "" la guerra los hizo subir "" in page 101 is claimed to allow only an animate reading for the clitic "" los "" , although for me it also allows an inanimate reading , but then this fact is claimed to hold only in spanish dialects where the pre-infinitival causee with "" hacer "" and an intransitive verb is attested , and i find this causative structure highly marginal ( examples such as "" la maestra hizo a los alumnos subir "" ) . and the construction exemplified by sentences such as "" me hizo pedir yo , "" which is analyzed in this book , is also alien to me . the main problem with these numerous discrepancies about the data is that it makes it hard to evaluate when a difference in the interpretation of the data is due to a difference in the data ( that may not be obvious ) or to a possible misanalysis of what actually is the same data . to illustrate this , consider the argument given in support of the claim that the structure embedded under "" hacer "" in a sentence like "" la guerra hizo subir los precios "" is a single unit ( p . 102 ) . torrego claims that standard constituency tests indicate that the sequence "" subir los precios "" in this sentence is a constituent and provides examples such as the following in support of this claim : ( 38 ) a . lo que la guerra hizo es subir los precios . what the war caused is to rise the prices d . que ha hecho la guerra sino subir los precios ? what has the war caused except rising the prices ? for me the translation of these sentences is not as indicated in the glosses , but rather as "" what the war did is to raise the prices . "" and "" what has the war done but raise the prices ? "" for ( 38a ) and ( 38d ) respectively . i would tend to believe that torrego is playing on the polysemy of "" hacer "" and "" subir "" . "" hacer "" can be either the causative verb meaning ' cause ' or ' make ' or the generic transitive verb translatable as 'd o ' , and "" subir "" can be either intransitive , equivalent to ' rise ' , or transitive , equivalent to ' raise ' . for the examples in ( 38 ) to be relevant to torrego 's claim , "" hacer "" must be causative and "" subir "" intransitive . what makes these exemples acceptable ( even though not perfect ) for me is that "" subir "" can be taken to be a transtive verb , whose unexpressed subject is coreferential with "" la guerra "" . but , under this interpretation , "" hacer "" would not be functioning as the causative verb , but as the counterpart of 'd o ' . what shows conclusively that , in my variety of spanish , this interpretation is right is that , if , instead of "" subir "" , we use a verb that only has an intransitive use , we get an unacceptable result . "" caer "" ' fall ' is such a verb : even though the sequence "" caer los precios "" can appear following the causative verb "" hacer "" , as in "" la guerra hizo caer los precios , "" it cannot appear as a focused or topicalized constituent of this verb , as we see in ( i ) . ( i ) a . * lo que la guerra hizo es caer los precios . what the war did / caused is to fall the prices b . * que ha hecho la guerra sino caer los precios ? what has the war done / caused except falling the prices ? > from this i would conclude that torrego 's data in ( 38 ) do not provide any evidence for the claim that a sequence such as "" subir los precios "" in a causative construction is a constituent , because those examples do not include the causative verb "" hacer "" . of course , i can only reach this conclusion for the variety of spanish that i am familiar with , where ( i ) is ungrammatical . but , for all i know , the examples in ( i ) could be grammatical in the variety of spanish analyzed by torrego , in which case my conclusion would not apply and the examples in ( 38 ) would constitute relevant evidence for the claim under investigation . analysis my second difficulty with this book is in the analysis ( or analyses ) provided . i have trouble understanding many of the analyses given : in many cases , i fail to derive the predictions that should follow from the analysis , i cannot tell what would constitute a counterexample to the analysis , i cannot figure out what role a given assumption plays in the analysis , etc . this could well be due to a deficiency on my part , but other readers might experience the same difficulties . next , i will point out some problem cases . 1 . chapter 2 of the book starts out with a list of six generalizations about marked accusative ( pp . 14-16 ) : ( 1 ) marked accusative can cooccur with doubling clitics in some dialects ( it is a necessary condition for clitic doubling ) , ( 2 ) marked accusative objects are interpreted as specific , ( 3 ) telicity requires marked accusative ( with animate objects ) , ( 4 ) the subject in a clause with a marked accusative object is an agent or a cause , ( 5 ) marked accusative is restricted to animates , and ( 6 ) affected animate objects require marked accusative . the indications given all along are that these generalizations will follow from a unified analysis . the main idea underlying this analysis is that an object with marked accusative raises to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes a vp as its complement . ideally , an overt movement operation of this kind should have some testable effects on word order and all of the properties of the construction should follow straightforwardly from this operation . however , as torrego notes , there is no visible effect of object raising on word order , so that the motivation for the analysis rests entirely on how well it explains the generalizations listed above . and these generalizations are explained by attributing the various properties that correlate with overt case-marking to the spec of v - vp position on a one-by - one basis . for example , it is proposed that the spec of v - vp has a specific interpretation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp may shift the aspect of the predicate to a telic situation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp gives an agentive interpretation to the subject , etc . one wonders why this analysis should be preferable to one that attributes all of these properties directly to overt case-marking : in both cases , a one-by - one stipulation of those properties is required . it is not clear what the advantage is in attributing these properties to a special phrase structure position for which very weak evidence is given . 2 . in pp . 23 ff , torrego claims that there are two types of marked accusative : marked accusative of non-affected objects is structural case , whereas marked acusative of affected objects is inherent case . however , this claim is faced with a major problem that torrego notes , but then simply disregards . inherent ( or quirky ) case has the generally accepted property that it is preserved under passivization : an argument with inherent case does n't lose or change its case marking when its clause is passivized . genitive and dative case in icelandic are a good example of this , and dative case in spanish is also a good example of case marking that does not change from active to passive . however , the marked accusative case of affected objects in spanish is not preserved ( see relevant examples in p . 28 ) . torrego notes that , in contrast with spanish , some hindi dialects preserve the accusative "" - ko "" marking in passives , citing mohanan 1990 . torrego then goes on to say ( p . 29 ) : "" if the marked accusative of "" affected "" objects were inherent , overt marking in passivization could be preserved ( just as the marking of datives and genitives is preserved in icelandic passives ) . it remains to be seen whether relevant data from the dialects of hindi confirm this expectation . "" but the relevant data from the dialects of hindi does confirm this expectation , as the examples from mohanan 1990 ( also mohanan 1994 ) show . if we agree that we identify inherent case because its case marking is preserved under passivization , then we must conclude that marked accusative case is inherent in some dialects of hindi , because its case marking does not change under passivization , but is structural in the other dialects of hindi , where it does change under passivization . and we are forced to conclude that it is structural in spanish because it is not preserved under passivization . to ignore this evidence and still conclude that marked accusative case can be inherent case in spanish is to devoid the distinction between structural case and inherent case of the conceptual and empirical substance that it is standardly asociated with . and torrego does not explicitly reject this association . 3 . the agentivity effect of clauses with marked accusative is explained as follows : following a suggestion of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) , the causative or the agent role can be understood as the interpretation assigned to the v - vp configuration ; since marked accusative is assigned to objects that raise to spec of vp , the presence of marked accusative implies the existence of the v - vp configuration . therefore , whenever there is marked accusative , there must be an agentive or causative interpretation . but what happens with verbs that allow an alternation between marked and unmarked accusative on the object ? this should mean that such verbs should alternate between a v - vp configuration and some other configuration , but this second option is not spelled out . also , we have no way of knowing what consequences the presence or absence of the v - vp configuration has other than on overt case marking and on the corelation between overt case marking and other properties such as agentivity . 4 . in pp . 34 ff . , torrego tries to relate the idea that marked accusative on affected objects is lexical quirky case to grimshaw 's ( 1990 ) theory of quirky case - marking . in grimshaw 's theory , arguments at argument structure are ranked by prominence in two tiers : the aspectual tier and the thematic tier . adopting this theory , torrego proposes ( p . 36 ) that "" an argument ( subject or object ) can be lexically or quirky marked when it has thematic or aspectual prominence relative to the other argument . "" it is unclear how one is to interpret this proposal . prominence is a comparative property : a is more or less prominent than b . to say that a has prominence relative to b is either meaningless or would be true of any pair of arguments in an argument structure : it is necessarily true of any pair of arguments a and b of an argument structure that a is in a prominence relation to b . torrego goes on to state : "" the two arguments of an agentive telic transitive verb are both aspectually prominent . "" but this should be true of all transitive verbs . torrego goes on to conclude : "" this approach covers the fact that the object of only agentive and caustive verbs can or must be lexically or quirky case - marked , and also covers the fact that the overall phenomenon of marked accusative case happens with verbs that have agentive subjects . "" i fail to see how these predictions are derived . 5 . regarding the animacy restriction on overtly case - marked objects , torrego proposes that the term "" actor "" is more appropriate to characterize the class of nominals that appear in marked accusative than the term "" animate "" . the motivation for this terminological change is found in the existence of some expressions denoting inanimate entities that can take overt case - marking , as in the following example ( p . 55 ) : ( 45 ) el acido afecta ( a ) los metales . ' acid affects metals . ' ( i suspect that the presence of marked accusative in this example has more to do with the verb than with the semantics of the object . ) torrego does not propose a definition of "" actor "" , but refers the reader to jackendoff 's ( 1983 ) characterization of "" actor "" as the character in an action-type event that performs the action . given this characterization , it is hard to see how "" los metales "" ' the metals ' in example ( 45 ) can be interpreted as the argument that performs the action of the event ; what would "" el acido "" ' the acid ' be , then ? torrego goes on to say : "" the distinction between "" animates "" ( or "" actor "" - like nominals ) and "" inanimates "" does not appear to be semantic in nature . "" this is an odd claim to make , given that the notion of "" actor , "" which is proposed to replace "" animate , "" is given a semantic characterization . the motivation for this claim , however , is found in the fact that certain expressions , specifically proper names of humans , can be used to refer to anything , from a boat to a magazine to a can of beer , and always require overt case morphology , as in the following example : ( 46 ) esconde * ( a ) barbara . ' hide barbara . ' it is suggested that a purely morphological property underlies overt case - marking , although no indication is given as to what this morphological property might be . possibly the most robust generalization about overt case - marking of objects in spanish is that it is restricted to "" animates "" , even though there are problem cases such as example ( 45 ) and "" personified "" expressions such as ( 46 ) . because of these problems , torrego gives no explanation for the correlation between case - marking and animate interpretation and between absence of case - marking and inanimate interpretation that we see in pairs such as ( ii ) and ( iii ) : ( ii ) a . esconde a este . ( ' hide this one ( male animate entity ) . ' ) b . esconde este . ( ' hide this one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) ( iii ) a . veremos a otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( female animate entity ) . ' ) a . veremos otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) general remarks torrego often appeals to intuition in the exposition of the analysis and does not work out the details of the analysis . the following remark , very reminiscent of chomsky 's style , illustrates this point ( p . 139 , end of 3rd par . ) : "" whatever the details of this intuitive account are , the general approach seems quite plausible . "" if one does not work out the details of an account , it is not possible to derive predictions from it , and therefore the theory is unfalsifiable . this work by torrego is part of a move towards deriving explanations from very general and simple principles that interact in complex ways with each other . this move is a welcome one , but we should be careful that it does not land us in vagueness and imprecision . there is a style of explanation in which appeal is made to principles , often unstated or imprecisely stated principles , from which predictions are claimed to follow , but in which the derivation of predictions ( the logical steps from which predictions follow ) is not worked out and it is not possible to know what a prediction of the theory really is and what a counterexample to the theory might be . there is a danger that a reader of torrego 's "" the dependencies of objects "" might have the impression that the explanations in this book are of this style . to prevent this impression , torrego should have made a greater effort in terms of exposition ( even if it means leading the reader by the hand ) to show how the various predictions are derived . for that , it is necessary to state the crucial principles explicitly , as numbered items so the reader can refer to them easily , to make the assumptions about representations also explicit , and to give step-by - step derivations of the various predictions . references chomsky , noam . 1992 . a minimalist program for linguistic theory . mit working papers in linguistics , no . 1 . chomsky , noam . 1994 . bare phrase structure . mit occasional papers in linguistics , no . 5 . chomsky , noam . 1995 . the minimalist program . mit press . grimshaw , jane . 1990 . argument structure . mit press . jackendoff , ray . 1983 . semantics and cognition . mit press . mohanan , tara . 1990 . arguments in hindi . ph . d . dissertation , stanford university . mohanan , tara . 1994 . argument structure in hindi . stanford : csli publications . reviewer : alex alsina , professor titular d ' universitat , faculty of translation and interpretation , universitat pompeu fabra , barcelona , spain . ph . d . , stanford university , 1993 . research interests include syntax , morphology , morphosyntax , argument structure , linguistic theory . reviewer 's address : alex alsina facultat de traduccio i interpretacio universitat pompeu fabra la rambla , 30-32 08002 barcelona spain alex . alsina @ trad . upf . es",0

"Killed My Independence Day Party""With all the spam that gets through, I had no idea a filter was in effect at the FoRK listserv. Turn it off! It not only risks silent false positives, but suffers them in such a way that individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. Also, anti-spam startups need end-users. Centralized spam fighting takes food out of those coders' mouths!I still think self-add whitelists are underrated. A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with all subscribers, and grow from there. Bouncing problem mail, in a way that humans can understand how to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids the problem of silent failures without opening the door to lazy, forged-""from"" spammers. - Gordon----- Original Message ----- From: ""Rohit Khare"" To: Sent: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 12:25 PM Subject: Re: HD/ID: High-Def Independence Day > On Sunday, June 30, 2002, at 12:18 AM, Rohit Khare wrote: > > You're all invited to join me for a South Bay Hi-Def spectacle at my > > apartment in Sunnyvale on the Fourth! > > So here's the final report on the HD/ID party.

"california update # 2 , 2 / 23 / 01 1 . bankruptcy an increasingly attractive option for davis despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms , back at the poker table in sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy . indeed , almost any reading of governor gray davis ' s political situation after the shock la federal court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet . at least one of the three major power generators ( pg & e ) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now , particularly after yesterday ' s ferc ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy . 2 . davis wants to keep hope alive until analyst meetings next week today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the national governor ' s association and meet with wall street analysts tuesday and wednesday . in fact , davis ' s desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in california . according to talks with all sides , davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers ( pg & e , socal edison and san diego ) for something like $ 7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells . but the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court - ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary , but politically difficult . according to key sacramento officials , "" confidence continues to wane in davis ' ability to do this . the plain fact is the stick he ' s carrying isn ' t awfully big . "" adds another : "" the key people here just think the utilities are playing him . either they ' re playing him , or he ' s going to roll on the price , he ' s going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth . the utilities got away with the same kind of thing before , in 1996 of course . "" davis is more astute than that , and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in los angeles . 3 . little support for transmission assets deal the transmission assets deal doesn ' t look attractive for anyone . davis has no particular affinity for it , having adopted state senator burton ' s proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade . the legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry , and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network . the utilities - - pg state offers only tepid support for bond scheme "" there are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn ' t pick up "" says one california official .

"I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums

particular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I
actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers

http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
of a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
live this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bisonâ€“one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
to Alaskaâ€“a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industryâ€“have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
Natureâ€“and lootersâ€“take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
don't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
from the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
ice patchâ€“and scores of others around the regionâ€“revealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
darts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
and St. Elias mountain rangesâ€“the United States' most glaciated
terrainâ€“and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're
probably about the only ones happy about it.""

""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?garyP.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before._______________________________________________

"NRI Number OneExpats help Hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expenseBy JEANNE E. FREDRIKSENThe expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey 
Bogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 
60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives 
are traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that 
they live ""elsewhere"" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and 
a bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of 
impact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, 
both at the box office and on the big screen.According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 
1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million 
Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs 
have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly 
in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is 
Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 
million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite 
handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of 
directors and producers.Among the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar 
box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho 
Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). 
The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boasts such films as Yaadein 
(2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain 
(HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. 
Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 
million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the 
U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box 
office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its 
first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its 
five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 
week run.Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of 
the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the 
brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that 
the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both 
commercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a 
circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these 
films' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these ""global 
Indians,"" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged 
off as a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been 
criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have 
performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to 
the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew 
up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, 
prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds 
in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In 
the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of 
the rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage 
approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, 
attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the 
longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the 
characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, 
which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. 
Because of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border 
separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into 
their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.In many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of 
the NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick 
than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts 
may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from 
the minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at 
the NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward 
mobility, the other offering traditions and history.Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, 
drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats â€¦The first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite 
encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually 
meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney 
troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible 
negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. 
Even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct 
the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back 
into one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with 
relentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. 
wrong, traditional vs. modern â€¦ in short India vs. the West.But this is not where the negativity ends.Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female characters to help 
the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more 
traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this 
does not seem to carry over to the men's characters.Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are 
constantly reeducated that ""This is not India â€¦,"" ""This is not America 
â€¦,"" ""Only in India â€¦,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less 
designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as 
if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their 
companies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected 
businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and 
considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros 
Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of 
ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing 
Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an 
opportunist, which seems to be a step up.Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, 
but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's 
splendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented 
as a naÃ¯ve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his 
singing ability.Yaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent 
from London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a 
therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes 
an American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling 
down, or having babiesâ€”hardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.And what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the ""modern"" vs. 
the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent 
home to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs 
outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar 
Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women.Show me the way to go home â€¦The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, 
more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for 
maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to 
unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the 
lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto 
theater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed 
houses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everythingâ€”homes, 
transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and 
tearsâ€”sets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life.""In K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For 
Anjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an 
all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of 
Indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her 
surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on 
the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own 
family and home.Overkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated 
representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the 
typical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without 
the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss 
their families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible 
amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person 
is rendered as no more than a racial statistic.""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even 
if they don't realize it,"" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI 
and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we 
will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the 
perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've 
forgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out 
who we are. I really don't think they have a clue.""On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. ""It's 
good that these films show our kids what happens in Indiaâ€”the 
traditions, customs, values,"" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater 
owner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in 
India, but the traditional values remain."" And many popular films target 
the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such as Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" adds Gandhi, ""are 
examples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a 
balance between the two for all of the markets.""Another positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a 
questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in 
commercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon 
Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which 
present NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen 
offers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, 
and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make 
the best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film 
also dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station 
attendants: characters who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, 
corporate crises, or overseas judgments.The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) 
by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal 
reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning 
NRIs in film, the boys are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet 
has some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most 
basic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be 
found in India.Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) 
incorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of 
Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the 
Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider 
interest than a small, rural village.Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the 
English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film 
Mitrâ€”My Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering 
messages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the 
questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the 
latter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. 
The characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their 
presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are 
revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or 
clichÃ©d answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, 
and Mitrâ€”My Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian 
communities in the U.S.While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office 
success outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers 
acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If 
the big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai 
often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office 
anywhere been adversely affected? Well â€¦ no, not by any charted reports 
that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back 
to the industry in Mumbai: ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it.""Nevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil 
side of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will 
discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas 
family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the 
homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own 
feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their 
hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. nNOTE: All box office figures are reported as US$ and are courtesy of 
Variety Magazine online archives. Not all Hindi films abroad report box 
office, and not all box office reports are available.Jeanne E. Fredriksen writes from Chicago. She is family with, friends 
with, acquainted with, and works for NRIs with an amazing variety of 
personalities, attitudes, hopes, dreams, goals, livelihoods, needs, 
wants, and beliefs.=========================================

Dilwale Dulhaniya Le JayengeSo globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard 
outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its 
screenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the 
entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile 
competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where 
Indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 
1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were 
Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without 
question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for 
viewing.Kabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamAccording to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, 
all screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, 
while pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on 
the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people 
revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and 
Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was 
impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of 
films by volume after India and the U.S. Â 	
=====================================================
Bhansali's Musical HeavenBy ANIRUDDH CHAWDADEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. 
Lyrics: Nusrat BadrFor perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met 
the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil 
De Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a 
semi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent ""Indian"" musical score, 
Bhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer 
monumental soundtrack.What is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by 
newcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya 
Ghosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a 
slightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, 
is the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in 
the Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's ""Silsila ye chaahat ka"" is a sultry 
tabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. ""Maar 
daala"" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical 
ragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On 
""Kahe chhed,"" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an 
intoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to 
finish out a piercing song of longing.While a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen 
lip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit 
Narayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target ""Bairi piya,"" a 
duet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. 
The up-tempo ""Chalak chalak"" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod 
Rathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on ""Dola re 
dola"" simply shakes the rafters.Packaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a 
cheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover 
with a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of 
about $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is 
without doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. 
But buyers beware: avoid being distracted by bootleg CDs. This 
exceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve 
unadulterated musical glory. Pop in only a properly copyrighted, 
original CD and let Darbar & Co. whisk you away on a magical musical 
ride.Lifelong cinephile Aniruddh Chawda lives, works, and writes from 
Wisconsin, on America's north coast.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.â€ The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor

line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen

http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2002392050,00.htmlYour vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEYWELCOME to Crop Idol Â– your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 
The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.
Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.
Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers Â— while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =
Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.Theories about their cause include whirlwinds Â— known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes Â— earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them.""Plus lots of photos

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

"they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.

"fw : wsj skilling interview enron ' s skilling cites stock - price plunge as main reason for leaving ceo post by john r . emshwiller 08 / 16 / 2001 the wall street journal page a 2 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) jeffrey k . skilling said that the pressure he felt from enron corp . ' s plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign tuesday as the energy giant ' s chief executive officer after only about six months in the job . in an interview yesterday , the 47 - year - old mr . skilling elaborated on his decision to leave houston - based enron . on tuesday , mr . skilling insisted he had resigned for "" personal reasons "" unrelated to enron ' s business activities . in the interview , he reiterated that he wasn ' t under any pressure to resign from the company ' s board or chairman kenneth lay , who has resumed the ceo ' s duties at the nation ' s biggest energy trader . however , yesterday mr . skilling said that his "" personal reasons "" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as ceo . calling the company ' s stock performance a "" kind of ultimate score card , "" mr . skilling noted that enron ' s share price had fallen by some 50 % this year . mr . skilling said he took that stock - price drop very personally . "" i put a lot of pressure on myself "" for that decline , he said . "" i felt i must not be communicating well enough "" with investors . he felt this particularly given enron ' s strong financial results over the past several quarters , based largely on growing volumes in its trading business , which covers a range of items , including electricity , pulp and paper . if the stock price had remained up "" i don ' t think i would have felt the pressure to leave , "" he said . in january , enron topped $ 84 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading . it closed tuesday , before the announcement of mr . skilling ' s resignation , at $ 42 . 93 a share . as of 4 p . m . yesterday , enron traded at $ 40 . 25 , after falling below $ 37 during the day . mr . skilling , who had been at enron 11 years , said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow enron employees , many of whom are shareholders . "" people would say ` what is going on with the stock , jeff ? ' i would have to say i didn ' t know . it has been frustrating , "" said mr . skilling . the self - portrait offered by mr . skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious , bright and thick - skinned business strategist whose long - held goal had been becoming enron ceo . mr . skilling said that the "" final straw "" in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to england in connection with the deaths of three enron workers in a power - plant accident there . that trip helped reinforce "" how tenuous life is , "" said mr . skilling , who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged . while mr . skilling said enron is in "" great shape , "" his departure raised anxiety in the investment community . merrill lynch , for instance , lowered its rating on enron to neutral from buy based on "" uncertainty "" created by the resignation . yesterday , an enron spokesman confirmed that mr . lay plans to name two executives to the existing "" office of the chairman "" within the next few days or weeks . the spokesman said mr . lay hadn ' t yet revealed whom the two would be . the office of the chairman had consisted of mr . lay and mr . skilling . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0

( since most e-mail won't support czech diacritics , i ' ll spell all czech forms phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicates its palatalization . ) typical of such verbs is the verb [ d ' elat ] "" to do "" : [ d ' ela : ] "" he / she / it does "" [ d ' elaji : ] "" they do "" [ d ' elaji : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appears in all persons of the present tense in related paradigms ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] "" to do "" 3rd per . sing . ) and creates a vjv sequence , which historically contracted into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' ela : ] ) . in most current phonological accounts of west slavic languages , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / is considered to be present underlyingly , but then needs to be deleted in almost all forms of these verbs . this representation seemed too abstract to me , and when i considered czech phonotactic restrictions ( see charts in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occurred to me that the / j / ( where it does survive ) may simply be inserted to break up impermissible v clusters or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nuclei . the only sticking point in this was that / j / often appears between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious features . as i found out from the responses and from searching i ' ve done since , the epenthesis of consonants between non-homorganic vowels is not as uncommon as one might assume . so far , the norm seems to be that cs inserted at morpheme boundaries will be glides ( even between non-high vs ) unless there is a relic consonant that has been retained , and sometimes analogically extended , in a given environment . in all cases i ' ve found where the inserted c is a relic , that c is coronal . more data would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mentioned several examples : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative forms , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zovals [ zo : ' ( v ) als ] "" like , as if "" ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain hosts and clitics ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i "" taller than - ep - i "" ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel clusters from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr james m scobbie ) some people might think that / r / sandhi in english is of the type you are looking for , but really / r / is just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowels , so it 's just like finding / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid inserting / r / in certain socially stigmatised environments , many speakers insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , has a clear case of a consonant appearing under certain circumstances involving what would otherwise be v - v sequences . the plural suffix is - le or - la ( depending on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' has the plural atla . however , if the plural suffix is itself followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel , an - r - appears : atlari "" m ' my horses ' . ( the 1sg possessive suffix is - im / i "" m / um / u "" m ) . the - r - is clearly historical , since the karachay forms with - r - are similar to the ordinary turkish form . that is , the turkish forms corresponding to the karachay ones given above are at , atlar , atlari "" m . the thing i do n't know is whether there is motivation for postulating this - r - in the underlying form of the plural suffix or not . there are some reasons to say yes and some to say no , so i ' m not sure . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : gladney @ vmd . cso . uiuc . edu i do n't have references , but here are three e examples i have noticed : freebie , sukie ( a diminutive of sue ) , and the l . a . lakers . best wishes , frank y . gladney . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : karlrein @ aol . com subj : intrusive glides i do n't know if this is what you are looking for , but portuguese has [ y ] s and [ w ] s that come between more open final and initial vowels . in some dialects ( continental and insular ) ' na agua ' is [ n ( schwa ) + y + agwa ] . when nasal vowels are on both sides , the [ y ] is nasal . in many varieties ( all ? ) ' no ano ' is [ nu + w + ( mid-central a ) nu ] . sorry about the lack of symbols . karl reinhardt , dept . of modern and classical languages , university of houston . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr to : jpkirchner @ aol . com for glide insertion in eskimo language you can see : jorgen rischel , topics in west greenlandic phonology , akademisk forlag , copenhagen , 1974 . insertion of nasal velar or nasal uvular to prevent the fusion of two long vowels . best regards philippe mennecier , muse ' e de l ' homme , paris = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : consonant insertion picard @ vax2 . concordia . ca ( marc picard ) i think you ' ll probably find find that most cases of consonant insertionare the result of analogy . in french , for example , what should be chante-il ' is he singing ' is actually chante - t-il , the epenthetic / t / having been introduced in all first conjugation verbs through the influence of a final 3 sg final / t / in the other conjugations , e . g . finit-il , fait-il , recoit-il , etc . also , because of final consonant deletion , words like abri 's helter ' and debit came to have an identical ending . however , because so many such forms alternated with morphologically complex words ending in / t / , some original vowel-final words acquired this consonant in composition so that , for example , abriter came to replace abrier ( which is still used in canadian french in the sense of ' to cover ' ) . you ' ll also find cases like clou ' nail ' with derived forms either with or without / t / , e . g . clouer ' to nail ' vs . cloute , clouterie , cloutier . although / t / is the 'd efault ' consonant , as it were , you ' ll also find cases like joli , jolie ' pretty ' yielding enjoliver ' to embellish ' ; you ' ll also find family names like joliet and jolivet . i ' m sure you can find out more about all this stuff in mildred pope 's from latin to modern french . marc picard = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ( in this one i have edited out those of mr . alvarez 's examples containing characters that did not survive transmission . he also included an extensive spanish outline of the guajiro language and people , which i ' ll make available to those who request it . jk ) subj : c - insertion in guajiro x - from : jalvar @ conicit . ve ( jose r . alvarez ) in guajiro , an arawakan language spoken in colombia and venezuela , all the six vowels show a contrast between short and long . long vowels ( written as double vowels in the practical orthography ) and diphthongs ( written as two vowels ) behave alike for the process of consonant insertion to be described shortly . whenever the situation arises where due to morphological concatenation we have a theme ( complex or monomorphemic ) ending with a long vowel and a suffix beginning with a long vowel , an epenthetic [ h ] ( written as j ) or [ w ] ( written as w ) is inserted to break up the impermissible vowel cluster . the choice of either [ h ] or [ w ] is simply a matter of dialect differences , [ h ] being preferred by the arribero speakers and [ w ] preferred by the abajero speakers . the insertion of [ h / w ] to break up vowel clusters applies with no conditioning by the surrounding vowels , that is , it is a general and very productive process . atpanaa + ee + chi - ) atpanaajeechi or atpanaaweechi "" it will be rabbit "" ke + kii + ee-shi - ) kekiijeeshi or kekiiweeshi "" he wants to have a ( good ) head "" a + ko ' ojoo + ee + shi - ) ako ' ojeeshi or ako ' oweeshi "" he wants / wanted to embrace "" contrary to what these few examples may lead one to suspect , this epenthesis in not conditioned by the presence of a long ee in the second half of the cluster . it is simply an accident of guajiro morphology that very common suffixes have this long vowel ( - ee future , - ee desiderative , - eema apparentative , etc . ) . however , only [ w ] is used in epenthesis in certain cases . this last case is particularly important in infinitive formation . a guajiro infinitive may end with one of the six long vowels aa ee ii oo uu uu [ this last vowel is / uu / with "" umlaut "" - - jk ] or with the sequence waa . this duality in infinitive formation is directly related with the phonological structure of the stem from which the infinitive is constructed : if the final syllable of the stem is light , that is , if it ends with a short vowel , then the final vowel is lengthened ; if the final syllable of the stem is heavy ( that is , if it ends with a long vowel or a diphthong ) , then - aa is suffixed , an epenthetic [ w ] being added . the infinitives ashakataa / a = shaka-ta - aa / ( 0 = get . off - tt-inf ) "" to get off "" y cheecheewaa / cheechee-aa / ( soft - inf ) "" to be soft "" illustrate this contrast . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thanks again to all who responded . i 'd welcome more examples if anyone knows of any . james kirchner jpkirchner @ aol . com",0

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.htmlWeevil pest warms to life in south-west LondonJames Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianThey're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.Owen",0
"the evaluation of parsing systems the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience of language-dependent ( especially for languages other than english ) and task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . submission may be in either hard copy or electronic form . the submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : dr john carroll cognitive and computing sciences university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained latex , postscript , or rtf formats , to john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . for each submission -

About 
                              NCUA
The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF)

                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal

I _think_ you need to install postgreql-odbc and its' dependencies. Then
probably a bit of configuration to open a port to the network. But
Matthias is right, this is not the right place for this question.To bring things back on topic, I was practicing my ""rpmbuild'n skillz""
and made an rpm with some simple software tools to drive my DVD+RW
burner. No GUI frontend, but it works just fine from the command line. I
even used it to burn a bootable DVD version of Red Hat 7.3.ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber/dvd+rw-tools-0.1.src.rpm--

5. SITE STATISTICS
0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);

the needs of the Open Source community.On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLESourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

"review of arboreal for windows review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk",0

"" i do n't have my copy of "" the origin of species "" here , so i can't give a real quote , but the above lines remind me forcefully of a problem early evolutionary biologists faced , one which darwin was painfully aware of . darwin had no "" theory of genetics , "" and in fact the then current ideas of genetics made precisely the wrong predictions for evolution . ( it was thought that a new trait would simply be blended in with already existing traits , instead of remaining a discreet inheritable trait . ) it was n't until mendel 's work on heredity was rediscovered ( in the 1930 's , if i recall correctly ) that the theory of evolution had a way of explaining why newly developed traits were not lost in a population like a single water drop would be lost in the ocean . the history of science is full of new theories that appear to have fatal flaws , but the theories are accepted anyway , in faith that an explanation will turn up later . ( another example is the idea that the planets revolve around the sun in space , rather than being attached to crystal spheres that rotate around the earth . what on earth : - ) holds them in their orbits ? ) stemberger also writes : > i ' ve never understood why it makes any difference at all to linguistic > theory whether highly language-specific information is innate or not . > > yes , it makes a lot of difference for e . g . language acquisition , but that 's > beyond the scope of what most linguists do . it 's not considered essential > to study the acquisition of warlpiri before you study the adult grammar , > most linguists study only adult grammar , and the main principles of grammar > have come from studies of adult grammar . it makes no difference if you ' re simply writing grammars that attempt to be descriptively adequate ( in the sense of "" descriptive adequacy "" that chomsky writes about in aspects ) . but it 's not clear to me that that is really a theory of anything . if , on the other hand , you want an explanatorily adequate theory of linguistics , you need to worry about how the learner comes up with the right rules . after all , no linguist , even the most brilliant , has ever come up with a descriptively adequate grammar of any language ; whereas every child ( down to some limit at the level of retarded children , i guess ) comes up with a way of producing and understanding his / her language in a descriptively adequate way . regardless of what you believe as to whether the child produces a descriptively adequate grammar , there is a great mystery here . if linguists have n't studied child acquisition ( they have , but stemberger is using a slight hyperbole here ) , it 's simply because they have made a decision about how to investigate the problem , not because they do n't thing that 's the real problem . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * mike maxwell phone : ( 704 ) 843-6369 jaars internet : maxwell @ jaars . sil . org box 248 waxhaw , nc 28173",0

"" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about "" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like "" cash for used 501 's . "" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . "" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal "" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' "" . witnessing a 501 deal "" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . "" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff "" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) "" . a used - 501 deal "" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for "" used 501s . "" "" 501 "" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a "" major used - 501 deal "" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because "" deal "" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like "" thing "" , a place of business where such transactions take place . "" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction "" "" a major used - 501 deal "" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . "" deal "" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to "" getting a good deal "" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( "" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business "" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for "" a major used - 501 deal "" . 1 . "" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans "" 2 . "" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand "" 3 . "" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans "" "" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . "" can best be paraphrased into : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 .

"re : 5 . 1462 comparative method geoff pullum has raised the question of the null hypothesis with respect to proto - world and long-distance relatedness . i would suggest that the lack of progress in the dispute may be due in part to the conflict between two ways of setting the null hypothesis . a priori , in terms of evoutionary considerations , long range relationships going back to a single ancestor are to be expected : this point has been made by numerous linguists in discussion , if not so often in print . however , methodological considerations force us to set the null hypothesis the other way , since we clearly cannot disprove long-distance relatedness . the problem is analogous to medical disputes : there are plenty of researchers who would like to show once and for all that homeopathy , acupuncture etc . are of no benefit in the treatment of the illnesses for which such effects are claimed . but all that can be said is that we have no scientifically respectable evidence that homeopathy works ( please note that this is a purely methodological point - i do n't want to see linguist cluttered with replies disputing the homeopathic facts ! ) the greenbergian dispute is even less likely to be resolved by disproving long-distance relatedness hypotheses than the homeopathic one , since in the latter case one can at least do controlled trials : while there have been proposals on controlling for chance similarities , there will always be too many variables involved for the greenbergian null hypothesis to be refuted . steve matthews",0

There's a switch statement in the program on argv[0].It's not including any options in the link.L.--

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

"comparative syntax while i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?",0

"re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ? i would add to fritz newmeyer 's caveats about limitations to syntactic reconstruction these fairly obvious two : 1 . for many syntactic dimensions , the choices are so few that chance resemblances are so probable as to obscure the evidence of common ancestry . 2 . there is consideration non-arbitrariness in syntactic systems , so that , again , resemblance arises from other than common ancestry . larry gorbet lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu anthropology & linguistics depts .

Forwarded-by: LZ A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping
with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would
turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would
erupt into cheers.However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead
silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, ""May I please
use the restroom?""The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should.""""Why not?"" the pastor asked.""Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most
private part is covered only by a fig leaf.""""Nonsense,"" said the pastor, ""I'll just look the other way.""So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the
stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he
came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and
dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give
the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and
said, ""Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just
because I went to the restroom?""""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender.  ""Would
you like a drink?""""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled pastor.""You see,"" laughed the bartender, ""every time the fig leaf is lifted
on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how
about that drink?""

"your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results .",0

option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
compatible media under licence.If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
competition.The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
them).  If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
is that BRU will do it.On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""--

So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of 
course, there's the ""they'll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions."" Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?Owen

clearly nobody ever goes to and, even if they had ever contemplated it, have

"re : equity investment fair value in turkey john , please , give me another day to elaborate . it ' s quite hectic here . vince enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe from : john bottomley 06 / 21 / 2000 03 : 41 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : equity investment fair value in turkey vince , any further thoughts on your end ? john vince j kaminski 19 / 06 / 2000 15 : 45 to : john bottomley / lon / ect @ ect cc : dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : equity investment fair value in turkey john , it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) . vince enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect subject : equity investment fair value in turkey vince , john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to value these options first , some additional information . option characteristics : - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company ) - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or turkish lire ) we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75 per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds ) are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term . we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy ) a few key points : - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation ) - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we obviously do not exercise . we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel rac ' s approach is double counting . if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information . regards , john bottomley",0

Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much

" email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
>> (especially those with multiple email addresses...).
>
> What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.
>
Ah the great spam debate wages on ...So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
my @hotmail account.I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
knowledgable.My half a cent here...: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)
Woo hoo!   Law school!)

Date: Not supplied[IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)

' s stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy company ' s release late monday of its much - anticipated third - quarter financial filing with the securities and exchange commission , which revealed potentially major new cash - flow and earnings headaches . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were at $ 6 . 991 , down $ 2 . 07 , or 23 % . enron once again topped the big board ' s most - active list with 89 . 9 million shares traded , more than twice the volume of the next most active stock . enron bond prices fell into the range of between 70 cents and 80 cents on the dollar , according to market observers . following the announcement earlier this month of dynegy inc . ' s plan to purchase enron for around $ 10 billion in stock , bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar . yesterday , a dynegy spokesman wouldn ' t comment on the status of the pending acquisition , other than to say his company was reviewing enron ' s third - quarter financial report , filed with the sec , as part of continuing "" due diligence . "" under the proposed acquisition , dynegy would exchange 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s 4 p . m . price yesterday on the big board of $ 41 . 70 a share , off $ 1 . 90 , the deal values enron shares at about $ 11 . 20 - - well above the current market price . monday ' s third - quarter financial report from enron , which supplemented and revised enron ' s earnings announcement last month , reinforced fears that the energy - trading company is in a "" precarious financial position and will be for awhile , "" said andre meade , head of u . s . utility research at commerzbank securities . as reported in the wall street journal , enron ' s sec filing monday said that because of the company ' s deteriorated credit standing , it might have to repay a $ 690 million note by this coming monday . the filing also said enron might be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax charge to earnings in the current quarter , ending dec . 31 , due to a drop in value of some of its assets . houston - based enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past month , since announcing big asset and shareholder - equity reductions in the third quarter . much of the turmoil has been caused by the company ' s dealings with partnerships headed by former enron officers , including its former chief financial officer . those dealings are the subject of a formal sec investigation . enron ' s financial woes have also led to a "" reduced level of transaction activity "" with the company by trading partners , the sec filing said . how well , or poorly , enron ' s energy - trading volume holds up is "" the million - dollar question , "" said simmons & co . analyst jeff dietert . enron ' s trading operation has been the company ' s main profit engine and the major attraction for dynegy in the acquisition deal . yesterday , other major energy - trading companies said they were still doing business with enron but were closely monitoring the firm ' s condition . standard & poor ' s ratings group also reaffirmed enron ' s credit ratings even though it said monday ' s sec filings "" raise liquidity issues "" for the company . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron , vdeg may bid to export bulgarian electricity , paper says 2001 - 11 - 21 03 : 40 ( new york ) sofia , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , seeks to export electricity from bulgaria to italy , dnevnik daily reported , citing unidentified sources from the state energy agency . enron , as well as two german companies , including vdeg , will be invited to bid at a tender for the national electricity company to select energy trading partners , the paper said . enron is being bought by rival dynegy inc . for about $ 20 billion . currently nec ead is the sole exporter of electricity from bulgaria , which provides energy to most of its neighbors , including serbia , macedonia , montenegro , greece , kosovo , albania , and turkey . last year the country exported electricity worth $ 117 million to turkey alone . opening the energy market to competition is part of the requirements for bulgaria to join the european union . the international monetary fund , which is expected to provide $ 150 million to bulgaria over the next year , also insisted on reorganization of the energy industry . raymond james analyst cartwright comments on enron disclosure 2001 - 11 - 21 07 : 45 ( new york ) new york , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - jon kyle cartwright , a senior vice president and senior energy analyst at raymond james & associates inc . in st . petersburg , florida comments on the enron corp . ' s disclosure that it may have to repay a $ 690 million note next week following the downgrade of its credit ratings to the lowest investment - grade level . the houston - based energy trader made the disclosure in a filing with the securities and exchange commission known as a ` ` 10 q ' ' on monday . ` ` i have to believe that dynegy knew about this , maybe not when the deal was signed , but certainly before the 10 q was published . there was wiggle room in the deal for both write downs , which effectively includes both the note and the potential write down for whitewing . ' ' ` ` there still appears to be enough liquidity to handle the write offs and the $ 690 million limited partnership note . ' ' ` ` over the short - run , the rest of this week , it is going to be difficult for anyone to trade with enron , because they should be generally concerned that neither enron nor dynegy has made public comments on this 10 q . ' ' ` ` if it is only for a few days , we ' re ok . as long as dynegy doesn ' t pull out of this deal , we should be ok , and enron should maintain its investment grade rating , and all the enron corp . bonds should mature without incident . ' ' ` ` hopefully the company will comment shortly . if there has ever been a company that couldn ' t afford to disclose a time bomb in a 10 q , it is enron . this should have been disclosed prior to this . it added to the crisis of confidence . ' ' ` ` we believe the company will be able to satisfy the $ 690 million note . it appears they should be able to do it from existing liquidity . they could renegotiate the note and / or the other bank facilities that would be jeopardized if they default on the note . ' ' ` ` even our buy recommendation on the enron notes is based on our belief that dynegy ' s management is credible because enron ' s lost all credibility with this disclosure . ' ' on the possibility that enron may be downgraded to junk ratings : ` ` nothing ' s too big to fail , and pg & e proved that . the core business at enron is the trading operation , and it is difficult for people to trade with any firm , particularly an energy trader , if there is any concern they won ' t be able to deliver on their side of the trade . ' ' enron stock punishment deepens debt woes cast pall over merger by tom fowler copyright 2001 houston chronicle november 21 , 2001 the continuing stream of surprises from the depths of enron corp . ' s balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegy ' s plans to buy its beleaguered competitor , but analysts say the deal remains on track . enron ' s share price dropped 23 percent tuesday to $ 6 . 99 after news the company had to restate its third - quarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a $ 690 million iou by monday . the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed . "" the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more , "" said prudential securities analyst carol coale , referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal . "" but at this point dynegy says they ' re still going forward , so i still have a positive outlook on it closing . "" the $ 690 million note payable , which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil , had been reported earlier . but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , which happened nov . 12 , was news to analysts and to dynegy . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended . negotiations are under way to do so , he said . the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enron ' s accounting department , said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday , but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations . "" the latest twists , while negative , are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not deal - breakers in our opinion , "" eassey said . "" at the level enron is being purchased , dynegy had clearly baked - in these types of uncertainties into its purchase price . "" enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enron ' s credit rating . officials with mirant corp . and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houston - based reliant resources is watching the situation carefully . "" we ' re being cautious , monitoring our position with them very closely , "" said joe bob perkins , president of reliant resources ' wholesale business . "" but i don ' t think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago . "" perkins said reliant officials read enron ' s 10 - q filing . "" the questions we had about that we addressed with enron , "" perkins said . he said the fuss over the 10 - q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron . "" it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron , "" perkins said . that doesn ' t mean analysts are resting easy . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the 10 - q sheds more light on enron finances , the information continues to be released piecemeal , making it likely more surprises are in store .

' ' if enron is out there standing on its own , i don ' t think that ' s sustainable , ' ' said a senior executive of one of enron ' s largest energy - trading competitors . besides dynegy ' s continued commitment to the merger , analysts and industry executives said the most crucial issue for enron was restoring the confidence of investors and trading partners in its financial health . the restatement of earnings two weeks ago and other disclosures about complex dealings with partnerships , some of them run by enron ' s former chief financial officer , had prompted the major credit - rating agencies to rate enron ' s bond ' s at the lowest investment - grade level . ' ' if the rating agencies take them below investment grade , they can ' t do business anymore , ' ' the rival executive said yesterday . ' ' that ' s become almost conventional wisdom . ' ' another downgrade could force enron to pay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , and it could prompt other energy traders to halt dealings with the company entirely . in fact , standard & poor ' s , one of the major credit - rating agencies , gave enron something of a vote of confidence yesterday . while it will continue to review the company for a potential downgrade , s . & p . said , it expects enron ' s near - term financial health ' ' to be sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its proposed merger with dynegy . ' ' s . & p . noted that enron was continuing to negotiate with major banks and other institutions for an infusion of $ 500 million or more in new equity and that enron executives still believed that the company would complete the sale of $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , raising badly needed cash . major energy trading companies continued to limit their exposure to enron and carefully watch the company ' s financial condition . officials at the el paso corporation and reliant energy , two large energy traders in houston , said yesterday that they continued to do business with enron . but others have pulled back . mirant , a large electricity generator and trader in atlanta , is ' ' trading on a very limited basis , and we don ' t expect to broaden that until enron ' s credit situation improves , ' ' a spokesman said . executives at two other companies that rank among the nation ' s largest traders but who spoke on condition their companies not be identified , also said they had scaled back trading . one of those companies was selling natural gas and electricity to enron only in cases in which the sales helped balance its account with enron , an executive said . ' ' we ' re trying to do business that offsets our risk , ' ' the executive said . ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said the company ' s ' ' transaction volume remains within the normal range , ' ' adding that there was ' ' no recognizable change ' ' yesterday in the number of companies willing to trade with enron . ' ' no one significant has dropped off , ' ' she said . analysts said enron ' s disclosures late on monday indicated that the company was using up cash more rapidly than had previously been thought . most of the $ 5 . 5 billion that the company has taken in through equity infusions and borrowings the last month has already been depleted . ' ' the cash burn is greater than anticipated , ' ' said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston . ' ' they are in obvious need of cash . ' ' she estimated that by next summer , enron could be $ 2 billion short of the cash it would need to meet its obligations . ms . coale noted that the $ 690 million obligation whose disclosure shook the markets yesterday was set off by a credit downgrade on nov . 12 - - two days before a conference call with investors . when she asked an enron official yesterday why the matter was not disclosed in the call , ms . coale said , she was told , ' ' we weren ' t aware of that contingency at the time of that call . ' ' donato j . eassey , an analyst in houston with merrill lynch , said in a report that dynegy , too , was unaware of the obligation . he calculated that enron had exhausted about $ 5 billion in cash the last 50 days . ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said that the company had paid off $ 1 . 9 billion in short - term i . o . u .

' ' now that the sale of dabhol is a certainty , the aggressive enron may be forced to adopt a pragmatic approach during the negotiations , ' ' said k . ravi , a utility analyst with the consulting firm of frost & sullivan . dabhol power ' s 2 , 184 megawatts of generating capacity was the showpiece of an economic liberalization drive in the early 1990 ' s . but enron has had repeated conflicts with politicians and environmentalists over the project . earlier this year , the maharashtra state utility , which has a contract to buy all of dabhol ' s output , complained that the prices were too high and stopped paying its bills , running up $ 64 million in arrears before the power was cut off and the plant shut down . enron raised the stakes in the dispute by serving notice that it would terminate the contract and pull out of the project . but a group of indian state - owned banks and financial institutions , with $ 1 . 4 billion committed to the project , countered with challenges to asset sales by dabhol and with other legal obstacles . earlier this month , a court ordered dabhol not to send the utility a final termination notice until dec . 3 . initially enron adopted a tough posture over the sale of dabhol . kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive and a close friend of president bush , was quoted as saying that india would have to face economic sanctions if the government did not create a favorable climate for the sale of enron ' s stake . but enron now will find little lobbying traction in either washington or new delhi , and the coalition - building diplomacy of the war in afghanistan makes it unlikely that the bush administration would agree to press india on enron ' s behalf . in september , the asking price for enron ' s stake in dabhol power was said to be over $ 1 billion . but the two serious indian bidders - - tata power and bses , both privately owned utilities backed by major industrial concerns here - - are reportedly willing to pay only about half that . if the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take - it - or - leave - it line , enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project that once gleamed with promise .

"" in light of that , "" said mr . gerber , "" we would expect to see a bit of an increase in sales on november . "" he adds that sales typically drop again in december as people opt to wait another month so they can defer capital gains for another year . in terms of overall purchases , "" insiders are obviously finding fewer bargains after this nice market surge , "" says jonathan moreland , director of research at newsletter insiderinsights . com . still , he says there are a few sectors where insiders have been indicating they see value in their own shares . among those , he says , are independent power producers , such as aes corp . and nrg energy inc . , which he expects will benefit from the need for new energy plants . he also points to lending institutions household international inc . and metris cos . , which because of their sensitivity to interest - rate moves have suffered on fears of a recession , says mr . moreland . but they are likely to "" benefit from the lower interest rates and an economy which will likely strengthen in the next year .

"" if this merger is to survive , equity investors will need to have a reason to buy the stock and their confidence will need to be restored , because the equity investor has been leading the way down . "" enron ' s hellish tuesday on the market came after the company made new disclosures in a u . s . securities and exchange document , filed after the market closed on monday . most pressing was news that enron has until nov . 26 to put up $ 690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnership . otherwise , the partnership could begin liquidating assets , including a brazilian gas company which enron plans to sell to raise $ 250 million . in the sec filing , known as a form 10 - q , enron said it was suffering a decrease in trading volumes , particularly in longer - term deals . trading volume down since the trading business - enron ' s crown jewel and the segment most coveted by dynegy - is low - margin , volume drives its profitability . it is too early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitability , enron said , but analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said dynegy will watch the volume drop carefully . "" if it has a long - term effect , it will definitely impact the value dynegy will put on this business , "" he said . dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lower volumes , and whether it was aware of the $ 690 million debt before it made its deal to acquire enron . "" we are in due diligence and enron ' s 10 - q is a part of the that process , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said . meade said the filing yet again showed enron ' s penchant for making disclosures bit - by - bit . of note was its latest downward revision of its third - quarter earnings , he said . "" the restatements are coming out piecemeal as they find them , and my guess is they don ' t know the full extent . we think further revisions are likely , "" meade said . one analyst who follows enron said the sec filing painted a darker picture of the company ' s cash position , given that it had $ 2 . 3 billion on hand as of nov . 16 . "" it shows that the cash drain on the company looks to be very significant , "" said the analyst , who asked not to be identified . standard & poor ' s said enron currently has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , but that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $ 1 . 5 billion from the dynegy merger , $ 550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets , and $ 3 billion from its revolving credit lines . another $ 450 pipeline - backed loan is expected in a day or two , and enron said it expects $ 500 million of private equity investment plus $ 800 million from asset sales . enron owes $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year , and its total liability for debt and other obligations is $ 16 . 86 billion , according to the sec filing . its merger with dynegy is expected to close by the third quarter of 2002 , raising the possibility that an enron without investment - grade credit might not have the liquidity to survive that long . enron acknowledged as much in the sec filing , stating starkly that it would be unlikely to "" to continue as a going concern , "" if a credit rating cut triggers the early payoff of $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to partnerships to which it belongs . enron said that if its rating were cut , it would work out other payment arrangements . s & p said a similar effort being undertaken in the case of the $ 690 million debt will likely be successful "" given the alignment of the interests between enron and the banks .

heim : well , enron filed their 10 q last night , as i think everyone knows , and it did include a modest restatement , but i don ` t really think that ` s the big news . more of concern is the debt obligation that you talked about , although even that is - - $ 690 million is manageable . but i think the 10 k filing has addressed many of the previous concerns about some of these limited related party partnership that enron has and the obligations , the backstopping enron has provided with those partnerships . hays : michael , could you just tell us a little bit more about that ? because it , it - - i get - - it ` s so complicated , i really have - - you know , have a hard time following it after a while . and what i can ` t understand is , presumably , the reason they were opposing this deal , dynagy and enron , is that dynagy knew what was going on , figured they were a lot of deals like this , so one - - i ` m kind of surprised that they would be talking about maybe triggering the material adverse charge at this point , which could get them out of the deal . i mean , they say they ` re not going to do it , but bankers say they ` re talking about it . so what ` s going on here ? heim : well , it ` s not unusual for deals to have a material adverse condition clause , and there was a lot that ` s unknown in enron . it ` s a very difficult company to follow , and dynagy certainly has done a lot of due diligence . but it was in a crash period , and i ` m sure there ` s a lot of questions dynagy has with enron as well . the - - dynagy was very careful on how they worded the deal and left themselves some outs . and i don ` t know if they ` re going to try and take advantage of those outs . but certainly i ` m sure they share a lot of the concerns that enron investors have . francis : is there another shoe to drop next week when these obligations come due on the 26 th ? heim : well . . . francis : and should we be braced for another big day in - - for enron stock , or has it found a basement ? heim : well , that ` s a very tough question to answer . certainly anybody who ` s been negative on the stock has done so not because they knew there were some problems coming , but because they didn ` t know that there weren ` t problems coming . and i certainly can ` t say that there isn ` t other problems that could be disclosed . yes , in situations like this , you have to rely a little bit on the company . and unfortunately the company ` s reputation ` s already been stained . francis : michael , you got a sell on the stock . is there a point at which this issue becomes attractive , or are there just too many potential bodies buried here ? heim : well , i ` m a firm believer there ` s always a point at which stock becomes attractive . but at this point , it ` s really become a betting game on whether the deal gets done . and there are certainly people , a lot of people speculating on that , both sides , and as an analyst , i don ` t know if you necessarily have a more insight to that type of question than somebody else . it ` s not a bet that we want to take at these prices . hays : ok , well , michael hime , you certainly , certainly got a lot of reasons , i guess , not to take the bet , certainly not before you have to . michael heim , a . g . edwards energy analyst , thank you so much for joining us . hime : thank you . francis : thanks . we appreciate it . copyright ?

' ' chevrontexaco chevrontexaco , the second - largest u . s . oil company , is providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout . it provided the first $ 1 . 5 billion a week ago . in exchange for that investment , dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than $ 2 billion if the enron purchase is not completed . shares of chevrontexaco , based in san francisco , rose $ 3 . 62 to $ 86 . 53 . enron yesterday reduced third - quarter results by 3 cents a share , bringing the period ' s loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million . on nov . 8 , enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books . that included a third - quarter reduction of $ 17 million . a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by standard ticker : ene ; url : ) losing steam again today . the stock closing down $ 2 . 07 at $ 6 99 cents a share . a nearly 10 - year low . investors apparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattled energy firm . joining us with more on enron ` s troubles is floyd norris , financial editor with ` ` the new york times . ' ' welcome to the program . floyd norris , financial editor , ` ` the new york times ' ' : thank you . romans : this has been a fascinating story and stock to watch develop . first off , what is the latest that drove this stock down more than 20 percent again today ? norris : well , yesterday , after the close , they filed a report with the securities and exchange commission , and as people studied it overnight , they were quite surprised . and it got worse this morning . they disclosed that they have $ 690 million in debt . so they may have to pay next week if they can ` t either come up with collateral , which will not be easy , or persuade the lenders to renegotiate . and what was shocking about that wasn ` t that the debt existed , that was known , it was that they had to pay it so quickly . it turns out , according to what people are telling analysts , that dynegy ( company : dynegy inc . ; ticker : dyn ; url : ) , which agreed to buy them only a week or two ago , didn ` t know about this . they had not told them , apparently , enron didn ` t realize they had this problem . romans : ok , wait . there seems to be a lot of things that wall street didn ` t know was going on . and every sort of revelation is a big blow to the stock . who is watching what ` s happening here and how can there be so many surprises . that ` s confusing to a lot of folks who are following this . norris : well , it ` s - the fact wall street is surprised isn ` t necessarily surprising , but the fact that enron seems to have been surprised is surprising . they ` ve had a lot of turnover . it reinforces the suspicion that jeff skilling , the chief executive officer who quit in mid - year , and perhaps the treasury and chief financial officer , both of whom were ousted within the last month as this crisis grew , may have been the only people who really understood what was going on there ; and that makes you wonder what else might yet come out . romans : well , what about auditors and what about the board governing this firm . and what about ken lay , i mean he is sort of the statesman of the industry , isn ` t he ? and he ` s running this company again ? norris : well , he ` s back running the company . the suspicion is , and lay denies it , he says he knows what ` s going on , my suspicion is that he didn ` t know the details . he trusted . he understood the company was overvalued , probably . this is a man who was taking out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock , exercising stock options and selling stock . but i suspect he didn ` t understand all of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him . the other thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the company is burning through cash at an amazing rate . and enron has not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning through the cash that fast . but it raises questions about whether the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken over by dynegy by next september . and , of course , the way the stock is trading , it ` s obvious that a lot of people on wall street doubt that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through on the announced terms . tracy eichler , ubs painewebber : floyd , my question regarding shareholder lawsuits . it seems like there ` s some validity there . any new news on the sec investigation and the magnitude to those lawsuits ? norris : there ` s no news on the sec investigation . there are , of course , huge shareholder lawsuits . they ` re filed against enron , they ` re filed against the current and former officers of the company . and they ` re filed against arthur andersen , which audited this company . the accounting regulators are already starting to check in again on arthur andersen , which used to be the class of the accounting business and has had a string of recent embarrassments . romans : all right , floyd norris for ` ` the new york times , ' ' thank you so much for joining us . norris : thank you .",0

"sum : native speaker intuitions several weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of "" native speaker intutions "" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach "" modern english grammar , "" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , "" john asked mary to leave , "" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like "" john asked to leave , "" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do "" generative "" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , "" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . ' john asked mary to leave , ' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) "" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as "" john asked mary to leave "" as meaning "" john asked mary 's permission to leave "" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that "" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we ' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . "" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in "" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , "" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that "" we ' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . "" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences "" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . "" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the ' permission ' reading peculiar . tony 's examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze 's forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : "" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 's were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . "" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous",0

IT talent solution
today!I've just got a few quick thoughts today.First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, 
CleverMedia is sponsoring karaoke night at Gnomedex. According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun -- it's what they do for a living! Between Leo Laporte, Doc Searls, Steve Gibson, Mark Thompson, Evan Williams, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly to miss out.Onward. Have a great day.

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers,
get your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Windows Apps in Linux? - Part III don't want to mince any words, here. CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.

Kernel Configuration - Part XToday we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.Tomorrow, we will dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.

"enron mentions - 11 / 19 / 01 headed for a fall ; companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . fortune magazine , 11 / 26 / 01 manager ' s journal : what enron did right the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 german bank is in talks with enron to buy a unit the new york times , 11 / 19 / 01 bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing los angeles times , 11 / 19 / 01 companies companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . janice revell 11 / 26 / 2001 fortune magazine time inc . 131 ( copyright 2001 ) it was an irresistible proposition : borrow billions of dollars , pay no interest , reap millions in tax breaks , and then wait for the debt to simply disappear . that was the promise of zero - coupon convertible bonds , and companies from enron to merrill lynch binged on what seemed like free money . but , of course , there was a catch : for this scenario to play out , a company ' s stock price had to rise sharply - - and quickly . that ' s because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity - - if the stock tanked , the bonds would no longer be worth converting . so to make them more attractive to buyers , companies had to build in an escape hatch : if the stock price failed to rise sufficiently , investors could "" put "" ( that is , sell ) the bonds back to the company - - in many cases , after just one year . and that ' s exactly what ' s about to happen - - to the tune of some $ 65 billion over the next three years . stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids , the prospect of conversion is now absurd . it simply won ' t happen . so bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can . and because of the put feature , that is possible . suddenly companies like tyco , comcast , and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they ' d never have to pay . that could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies . after all , they ' re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due . huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders . companies without enough cash - - and the majority fall into this camp - - are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew . that means sharply reduced earnings . especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings - - prime candidates for killer refinancing costs . some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt , creating significant shareholder dilution , especially at current depressed prices . to make matters worse , this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking . "" this is a ticking time bomb , "" warns margaret patel , manager of the pioneer high yield bond fund , a top - performing junk fund . the seeds of this mess were sown in mid - 2000 , when the stock market started to falter . companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling . zero - coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn ' t have to make cash interest payments on the bonds ( hence the name "" zero "" ) . instead issuers offered an up - front discount - - for instance , investors would buy a bond for $ 700 and collect $ 1 , 000 when it matured . companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares . but the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantly - - in many cases , by more than 50 % . with that protective feature ( called the conversion premium ) , zeros took off . corporate issuers would pay no interest , and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels , the debt would be swept away into equity . "" if the bonds are converted , it ' s a home run for everybody , "" says jonathan cohen , vice president of convertible - bond analysis at deutsche bank . that four - bagger , of course , depends entirely on the stock price rising . if it doesn ' t , the bondholders , armed with that handy put feature , can simply sell the bonds back to the company . great for bondholders , but not so hot for the company or its shareholders . but , hey , what are the odds of that happening ? "" cfos and ceos believe that their stock will just continue to go up , "" says cohen . "" they don ' t worry about the bond getting put . "" if all this seems a little complicated , that ' s because it is . a real - life example should help . california - based electric utility calpine issued $ 1 billion in zeros in april to refinance existing debt . at the time , the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 55 a share - - severely undervalued in the opinion of company management . "" we really didn ' t want to sell equity at that point , "" says bob kelly , calpine ' s senior vice president of finance . so the company instead opted to sell zeros , setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37 % . still , with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile , the bonds weren ' t exactly a screaming buy for investors . so calpine added the put feature : investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price , eliminating any downside risk . things haven ' t exactly worked out as management had hoped . the stock has since plummeted to $ 25 , and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense . so it ' s looking as though calpine will be liable for the $ 1 billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this april . there ' s also the refinancing cost . according to kelly , calpine ' s borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8 . 5 % - - an extra $ 85 million per year in cash . "" obviously , nobody plans for their stock to go down , "" kelly says . "" i don ' t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put . "" calpine ' s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk . "" if you are a borderline investment - grade company , a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world , "" notes anand iyer , head of global convertible research at morgan stanley . the problem is , there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there : jeff seidel , credit suisse first boston ' s head of convertible - bond research , estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category . and others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put date . today , with junk yielding as much as 5 1 / 2 percentage points above bonds rated investment grade , refinancing can be a pricey proposition . contract manufacturer solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk . it has $ 845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this january , and another $ 4 . 2 billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years . because of slower - than - expected sales , the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies . and if solectron ' s credit is downgraded , the zeros would slide into junk status , a situation that could cost the company - - and its shareholders - - tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges . refinancing isn ' t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros . companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds - - up to 3 % of the amount raised . if the debt is sold back , many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one - year loan . "" they ' re getting bad advice , "" claims one banker who didn ' t want to be named . "" look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into . "" as if those potential consequences were not scary enough , shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued . that ' s because some 40 % are bought by hedge funds , which short the company ' s stock ( sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price ) at the same time that they buy the bonds . if the stock goes down , the shorts make money from their position . if it goes up , they profit by converting the bond to stock . this hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet , at least for a while . grocery chain supervalu , for example , recently lost 10 % of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $ 185 million in zeros . despite all the pitfalls , the love affair with such pollyanna bonds continues , thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide . in fact , the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing . even better , thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code , companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they ' re actually paying . all they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail . verizon communications , for instance , would pay 0 . 25 % annual interest on its $ 3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below 60 % of the issue ' s conversion price . in the eyes of the irs , oddly , that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction , for tax purposes , of 7 . 5 % - - the same rate it pays on its regular debt . ( why ? trust us , you don ' t want to know . ) that adds up to an annual deduction of more than $ 200 million , even if verizon never shells out a dime in interest . not surprisingly , more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses . "" it ' s an incredible deal for them , "" says vadim iosilevich , who runs a hedge fund at alexandra investment management . "" not only are they raising cheap money , they ' re also doing tax arbitrage . "" so despite the enormous risks to shareholders , companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip : according to convertbond . com , seven new issues , totaling $ 3 . 5 billion , have been sold since oct . 1 alone . "" i think the power of the tax advantage is going to keep them around , "" says csfb ' s seidel . call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly - - it doesn ' t really matter . either way , it ' s the shareholders who ' ll be left paying the bill . feedback : jrevell @ fortunemail . com the bill comes due companies issued convertible zeros , with put features , when the stock market soured . now repayment looms . 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 amount issued , $ 5 . 2 $ 19 . 6 $ 37 . 5 in billions amount puttable , $ 2 . 4 $ 2 . 6 $ 4 . 8 $ 22 . 0 $ 19 . 1 $ 24 . 0 in billions source : convertbond . com when zero is a negative number the danger posed by convertible zero bonds depends on a number of factors , according to morgan stanley ' s convertbond . com : the size of the bond , the put date , the company ' s credit rating and cash on hand , and how far the stock must rise for the bond to convert to equity .

"" but creative destroyers are not necessarily likable , pleasant folks , which may be part of enron ' s problem today . - - minimization of transaction costs and frictions . enron extended the logic of de - integration to other industries . an integrated paper company , for instance , owns forests , mills , pulp factories , and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller , specialized firms . enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of "" customers "" and "" suppliers . "" enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free - market terms would be better than those of the internal operations . the development of free - market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy . - - exploiting the optionality in networks . in the old regulated environment , natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline . enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources , opening the customer to the benefits of competition , and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies . enron benefited from controlling switches on the network , so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use , and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons . this policy , picked up by others in the industry , created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers . - - rigorous risk assessment . the strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed , and of very strong internal controls . enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere . particularly with the advent of enron online , where enron made new positions valued at over $ 4 billion each day , it became essential to have up - to - the - second information on company - wide positions , prices and ability to deliver . the unexpected bad news from enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm , but with fears among trading partners about enron ' s ability to finance its trading activity . in a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite , counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance . it was the erosion in equity , rather than trading risk , that destroyed the firm . - - a culture of urgency , innovation and high expectations . enron ' s corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all . the hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic , hierarchical , formal , slow , and full of excuses . and the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company - - enron only 15 years ago - - is even duller and slower . enron became bumptious , impatient , lean , fast , innovative , and demanding . it bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses , create markets , and transfer within the firm . success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion , and an open - office design fostered brainstorming . the firm ' s organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs . this was a lightning rod for the firm ' s detractors . and yet , it could serve as a model for more hide - bound enterprises to emulate . enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of american business . it created a ruckus in once - quiet corners of the business economy . it rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business . it thrived on volatility . the proposed sale of enron to dynegy risks the loss of a major r & d establishment , especially given dynegy ' s track record as a second mover following enron ' s lead . beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time - consuming antitrust review , dynegy ' s greater challenge will be to find a way to make enron ' s spirit of innovation its own . or so we all should hope , because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries . - - - messrs . bodily and bruner are professors at the university of virginia ' s graduate school of business administration . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) by susanne craig staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) you know things are bad on wall street when the winner of a stock - selection contest can ' t come close to breaking even . j . p . morgan chase & co . ' s portfolio was the only one in the wall street journal ' s quarterly stock - picking survey to slide less than 10 % during the three months ended sept . 30 . the value of its stock basket fell 8 . 6 % during the third quarter . just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index , which dropped 14 . 7 % during the period . among the star performers that came to j . p . morgan ' s rescue : northrop grumman corp . , sbc communications inc . and procter & gamble co . "" it has turned into a real stock - picker ' s market , "" says j . p . morgan equity strategist douglas cliggott . "" in the first half , the market bought cyclical stocks , such as credit cards and brokers , in hopes of a recovery . we don ' t think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003 . "" instead , the firm ' s portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples , as well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment . the quarter was among the roughest in years for wall street investors . the terrorist attacks of sept . 11 helped contribute to the stock - market losses , which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey , though the markets have since recovered to their pre - sept . 11 levels . the last time the group posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998 , during the asian financial crisis . goldman sachs group inc . and credit suisse group ' s credit suisse first boston finished at the bottom of the pack , falling 23 . 2 % and 30 . 1 % respectively . the performance of last - place finisher csfb was dragged down by losses at companies such as veritas software corp . ( down 72 . 3 % in the quarter ) , praecis pharmaceuticals inc . ( down 64 . 8 % ) and software provider amdocs ltd . ( down 51 % ) . for csfb , "" it was not a good stock - picking quarter , that ' s for sure , "" says al jackson , the firm ' s global head of equity research . "" it was our tech and telecom . . . and the events of sept . 11 that hurt us . "" credit suisse first boston recently changed the approach to its model portfolio , opting against sector weightings , mr . jackson says . this strategy has hurt csfb in recent quarters , because of the steep slump in areas such as technology and telecom . the firm recently added a number of old economy stocks to its portfolio , such as citigroup inc . , dow chemical co . and gannett co . says mr . jackson : "" we are going back to our roots and asking what our best ideas are . "" like csfb , goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology companies , such as check point software technologies ltd . ( down 56 . 5 % in the quarter ) . its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled enron corp . ( down 44 . 3 % ) . morgan stanley and royal bank of canada ' s rbc dain rauscher , which placed 6 th and 12 th respectively , also have the energy company on their lists . in addition to enron , stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks , such as lodging giant starwood hotels & resorts worldwide inc . , walt disney co . and airlines such as skywest inc . , also hurt the portfolio performance of many securities firms . it is unlikely people will buy any company ' s entire recommended list at one time . the journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how their portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking . calculations in the quarterly survey , done for the journal by zacks investment research in chicago , take into account capital gains or losses , dividends and theoretical commissions of 1 % on each trade . overall , edward d . jones & co . , of st . louis , emerged with the most consistent results across the board , placing second in the quarter and for the year . its 85 % return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the total return for the s & p 500 of 62 . 7 % . perhaps more than any other firm , edwards jones takes a buy - and - hold approach to investing , making very few changes to its portfolio from quarter to quarter , or even year to year . "" it ' s the old story of the tortoise and the hare , and we believe slow and steady wins the race , "" says david otto , edward jones director of research . "" we are really , really proud of the five - year number . we believe in getting rich , slowly . "" on a quarterly basis , the portfolio of prudential securities inc . , a unit of prudential financial , came in second only to j . p . morgan , falling 11 . 8 % . however , investors sitting with the stocks prudential recommends haven ' t done as well in the long run . the value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45 . 9 % in the past year , finishing ahead of only lehman brothers holdings inc . , which posted a one - year loss of 54 . 9 % . seven firms managed to beat the s & p 500 index during the past 12 months , which fell 26 . 6 % in the period . lehman , which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to its heavy weighting in technology , managed to move up in the rankings this quarter . this primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in its portfolio , known as its "" ten uncommon values .

' ' in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , told analysts in a conference call last week . those investments ' ' have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined , ' ' he said , citing the azurix water business , of which wessex water is a part , and energy assets in brazil and india . executives from enron were not immediately available for comment today . westlb executives declined to comment . westlb has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in britain , bidding for british telecommunications ' phone network and the nation ' s railway tracks controlled by the troubled railtrack , which is restructuring under government supervision . neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stages . last summer , westlb helped finance the management buyout of the mid kent water company through swan capital , its private equity vehicle . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new by jathon sapsford staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) when at & t last week completed the second - biggest bond sale in history - - capping one of the busiest bond periods in years - - it came as welcome news amid fears of a credit crunch . here was new money , meaning new spending on plants , equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump . that $ 10 . 9 billion at & t deal , and a slew of similar bond deals from big companies ranging from boeing and anheuser - busch to kraft foods and general motors , may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on . that is because corporations , like homeowners , are in the midst of a refinancing boom . corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap , but because they often can ' t get money in other crucial markets . in particular , they are sidestepping the commercial paper market - - short - term corporate ious used to finance day - to - day operations , where rates traditionally are lowest - - because investors are unwilling to finance many well - known corporations . the result has been a huge jump in bond sales , the majority of which are used to reduce existing debt . since the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , about $ 135 billion in investment - grade bonds have been sold , up from about $ 78 billion in the year - earlier period . overall issuance this year is likely to set a record , clearing $ 600 billion , compared with $ 411 billion in 2000 . "" the driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short - term commercial paper to long - term debt , "" says john lonski , chief economist at moody ' s investors service , a credit - rating agency . usually , rising bond issuance presages economic growth . in 1991 , corporations sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates . but then , companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations , a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990 s . this time around , the surge in bond deals won ' t pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference . though , as in the case of the millions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments , it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate - balance sheets and help to fund some of the companies ' day - to - day operations . not all of the money being raised is to refinance short - term debt , of course , and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation ' s biggest borrowers have ready access to funding if they need it . but most companies are similar to at & t , which last week provided the biggest refinancing example yet . over the next three months , the telecom company was facing $ 6 . 5 billion in expiring commercial paper . under normal conditions , corporations pay off maturing commercial paper by "" rolling over "" that debt , or issuing new commercial paper to replace the old . but rolling over commercial paper became much harder for at & t after moody ' s cut the company ' s short - term and long - term credit ratings . through the bond deal , at & t raised money at relatively attractive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial - paper market . other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercial - paper market through bonds , loans or revolving credit lines . "" the ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital markets , "" says meredith coffey , senior vice president at loan pricing corp . , a debt - market - analysis company . for the most extreme cases , the bond markets don ' t offer refuge . enron , hammered by a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million that led to a string of downgrades , drew down $ 3 . 3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper . it then turned to its banks for an additional $ 1 billion loan to pay off more commercial - paper investors , thus tiding it over until it could merge with rival dynegy . most investment - grade companies aren ' t nearly so bad off , and thus have ready access to bond investors . general motors , for instance , had little trouble selling $ 6 billion in debt last month , while ford motor easily sold bonds totalling $ 9 . 4 billion . but the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment - grade companies are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money . take ford . standard & poor ' s and moody ' s downgraded ford ' s debt ratings last month to triple - b - plus and single - a - 3 , respectively . with that rating , ford is far enough down the spectrum of investment - grade debt that many of the ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won ' t touch it , meaning that it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt . ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial - paper market . boyce greer , the money - market group leader at fidelity investments , says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability - - even before they get downgraded . "" you can ' t wait around for a rating agency [ to downgrade a company ] , "" he says . moody ' s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year . thus , the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to $ 1 . 4 trillion at the end of october , down from $ 1 . 6 trillion at the end of last year . - - - friday ' s credit markets last week was a brutal time to own treasurys . the market sold off so sharply as to push yields , which move inversely to prices , almost back up to where they stood before the terrorist attacks . it was the worst bond selloff since 1987 , according to economists at banc one capital markets . losses were heaviest in issues like the two - year note , the most sensitive to expectations about federal reserve policy . since hitting a record low of 2 . 30 % on nov . 7 , the two - year yield has risen 0 . 80 percentage point to 3 . 05 % . in the same period , the 30 - year bond yield has risen 0 . 50 percentage point to 5 . 27 % . at 4 p . m . friday , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was down 1 3 / 32 points from late thursday , or $ 10 . 94 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 25 / 32 . its yield jumped to 4 . 897 % from 4 . 756 % thursday . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price fell 1 19 / 32 to 100 25 / 32 to yield 5 . 317 , up from 5 . 211 % thursday . why the selloff ? people in the market cite a shift toward the view that the u . s . economy may finally be on the brink of recovery . that means the fed may not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track . - - michael s . derby and steven vames copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing bloomberg news 11 / 19 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 2 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . investors hope the energy trader ' s third - quarter report to the securities and exchange commission will answer some of the questions that sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival dynegy inc . enron , which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it makes money , may disclose in a filing expected today more on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships , as well as any planned job cuts and other cost - saving moves related to dynegy ' s $ 24 - billion buyout . enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 % in three weeks amid an sec investigation into partnerships run by enron executives . investors worry that new disclosures , such as previously unreported debt , might threaten enron ' s credit rating and scuttle the merger , possibly pushing enron into bankruptcy . enron chairman kenneth lay acknowledged last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to dynegy , and he and other executives pledged to be more open with investors . enron shares fell 48 cents friday to close at $ 9 on the new york stock exchange . dynegy fell $ 1 . 53 to $ 42 . 47 . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report , which had been expected last week , was delayed by the dynegy talks and a restatement of earnings , chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said . enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $ 586 million to include losses from affiliated partnerships . today ' s filing , called a 10 - q , will include a balance sheet summarizing assets and debts . enron for years has omitted balance sheets , which the sec requires as part of the 10 - q , from its press releases announcing earnings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . companies & finance international - dynegy bid faces long wait . by nancy dunne and andrew hill . 11 / 19 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved dynegy ' s $ 9 . 8 bn rescue bid for enron , the larger rival energy group , poses complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which is likely to lead the review of the bid . officials from the two houston - based companies , which announced the deal 10 days ago , estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months to complete . but the ferc review could take longer , according to experts , and approval of the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel securities and exchange commission investigation into enron ' s finances . "" it ' s very complicated . it will be very time - consuming , "" said one person close to the ferc commissioners . as of friday , the groups had not yet filed for ferc approval . "" ( the deal ) raises issues that have never been considered before by ferc , "" said edward comer , general counsel to the edison electric institute , the association of us electric utilities . "" it has never considered the merger of two huge marketers , and in the past , marketing wasn ' t considered as significant a portion of the energy sector as it has become . "" a typical deal now takes about 200 days to win ferc approval . but mr comer said approval of the dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two years . the agency ' s guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the market power to push prices above competitive levels for "" a significant period of time "" . it analyses market power by identifying the products sold , the customers and suppliers affected and market concentration . "" mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets , "" said patti harper - slaboszewicz of frost & sullivan , a market research and consulting firm . "" the rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated . "" now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calculated . it could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market power because information on the trading books of companies such as enron and dynegy is closely guarded , she said . the two companies must also win consent from either the justice department or the federal trade commission , and from states where the companies have pipelines and provide retail services .

"" but they are getting more open , "" mr . oubadia said , though russia ' s lax financial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign investors . with $ 49 million in assets , the pilgrim russia fund invests between 90 % and 95 % in russian stock , with the balance held in cash . "" while the global economy is slowing , russia is still in an expansion mode , "" mr . oubadia said . after years of economic reforms , consumer spending is up 10 % and the former soviet union ' s gross domestic product is expected to grow 3 % to 5 % next year , more than twice as much as that of the u . s . and europe . two - thirds of the fund ' s stocks are oil and gas companies , which are still the most liquid stocks in russia . utilities , mining , telecommunications companies and breweries make up the rest . "" there ' s no escaping oil and gas if you want to manage a russia fund , "" mr . oubadia said . the spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthwhile , propelling earnings growth for russia ' s oil and gas companies . higher oil prices also worked wonders for the russian economy , which is largely dependent on oil and gas . more recently , however , falling oil prices have threatened the companies ' profit growth . but the fund manager , who is based in the hague , said he doesn ' t think people should invest in russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects . "" you don ' t invest because of earnings growth - - there will be none for russian oil companies this year . you invest because of the stocks ' low valuation , "" mr . oubadia said , adding that most of the russian oil companies still trade well below the world - wide average for the sector . yukos oil is one of the fund ' s largest investments , making up about 12 % of the fund ' s holdings . surgutneftegaz and lukoil holdings also make up more than 5 % each of pilgrim russia ' s assets . while mr . oubadia said the companies should be able to handle falling oil prices , partly by cutting production , he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile russian stock market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks . "" can russian markets do well with lower prices for oil ? "" he asked . "" the short answer is yes . but how low will prices drop ? "" mr . oubadia acknowledged that weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas into other russian sectors , including telecom stocks and consumer products . the russia fund isn ' t for the timid . in 1998 , when the russian economy collapsed , the fund - - then called lexington troika dialog russia , lost 83 % of its value . a year later , the fund soared 160 % . in 2000 the fund finished down almost 18 % . - - - janus stock shuffle : janus capital corp . bulked up on lower - priced value stocks and shed some shares of its long - held technology companies during the third quarter , a new securities and exchange commission filing showed . the denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter , it lowered its investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of june 30 . the largest reduction was a 43 . 6 million - share sale of nokia corp . stock . after the sale , janus still owned a large 183 . 2 million - share position in the wireless - phone company at the end of the third quarter . during the quarter , janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech companies emc corp . and sun microsystems inc . in addition , the fund company , a unit of stilwell financial inc . , trimmed its exposure to energy company enron corp . , selling 1 . 5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41 . 4 million shares at the end of september . on the buying side , janus , one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990 s thanks to bets on leading technology stocks , about doubled its position in software company microsoft corp . it also boosted its holding in the investment company run by warren buffett , berkshire hathaway inc . , while starting a small position in philip morris cos . , whose dividend - rich stock is usually more popular with price - sensitive "" value "" managers . janus has introduced new value portfolios recently , but most of its investors ' assets still follow faster - growing companies . - - aaron lucchetti and todd goren copyright ? 2000 dow jones source : world reporter ( tm ) the sunday telegraph the german state - owned bank , westlb , is in talks to buy wessex water from its troubled us parent enron . westlb is thought to be one of a number of financial buyers to have approached enron with a view to acquiring wessex , which is valued at more than agbplbn ( el . 63 bn ) . enron , the energy trading group which bought wessex in 1998 for agbpl . 4 bn , is being bought by its much smaller us rival dynegy after collapsing into financial crisis . the independent on sunday the water and sewage company wessex water is understood to be up for sale following an offer to take over its owner , enron . three years ago , enron spent agbpl . 4 bn on wessex water . but dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on us and european energy assets and is not interested in non - core assets . any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the industry is put off by regulatory problems , and the company ' s results have worsened due to imposed price cuts over the past year . copyright ?

"comparative method : n - ary comparison again some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 .",0

File-traders in the crosshairsWhen the recording industry last month let slip plans to sue individuals who trade copyrighted songs on file-swapping services, Web surfers everywhere pulled down their MP3 collections in a frenzy of fear.
OK, not really. Despite the music industry's hopes, such threats have so far been met with a collective yawn in the file-swapping community, which has yet to see much damage in spite of repeated legal wrangling with the Recording Industry Association of America.

The study by Mi2g also found that successful attacks on U.K. and U.S. government sites have decreased, which may be due to tougher laws and improved security.

Here is my recipe for Maildrop:# Vipul's Razor check

log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE""
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
  xfilter ""reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'""
  log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""
  to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/""
}I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.HTH,

"update on ammonia shutdowns / terra chemical high prices force chemicals to sell gas , futures chemical companies , forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices , are nevertheless making money - - - by selling gas futures contracts . terra industries and mississippi chemical corp . became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs . iowa - based terra industries said it had sold off a portion of its december natural gas purchases , and shutdown 50 % of its verdigis , ok , ammonia facility . the company had previously reported that it would not operate its bytheville , ar , and beaumont , tx , facilities during the month of december as well . in a similar maneuver , mississippi chemical corp . , a producer of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium - based products in mississippi , louisiana and new mexico , reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from january forward , in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices . mississippi chemical said it expects to realize a pre - tax gain of $ 16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending dec . 31 from the recently sold contracts . the problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices . an overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low , while gas prices , a feedstock for some chemicals , continue to climb . the difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products , said ron phillips of the fertilizer institute . duke energy ' s ken nyiri , divisional director of strategic planning and research , commented on mississippi chemical ' s transactions , "" i guess they probably made about a $ 4 / mmbtu margin on the gas , which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia ; in fact , they would have lost $ 30 / unit . their ammonia was probably costing them about $ 205 / ton to make ( with gas bought at $ 5 / mmbtu in november ) and the market today is at $ 205 so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs . by selling the gas at around $ 9 / mmbtu they made $ 4 / mmbtu . it was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it , or do they sell the gas and make $ 16 million . "" michael l . bennett , executive vice president of terra , said , "" the natural gas price increase since our december requirements were purchased for verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas . we will evaluate the economics of bringing verdigris back to full production near the end of december when january ' s natural gas purchase commitments must be made . "" terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40 % , 30 % , 77 % and 88 % of the company ' s north american ammonia , uan , urea and methanol manufacturing capacity , respectively . the production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas . phillips said "" the latest data we had in october was that of the companies that we survey , which is not the entire ammonia market , but a good bit of it , we were looking at operating rates of 76 % . "" currently , a total of 4 - 5 million tons / year of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about 20 - 21 million tons / year of production capacity . "" clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [ rather than producing ammonia ] , "" said nyiri . "" it ' s the prudent thing to do , i think , in this marketplace . buy your ammonia if you can . at $ 9 gas , that costs you $ 350 / ton to make the ammonia , which is $ 145 more than the current market is willing to pay . "" a spokeswoman for mississippi chemical said the company held on to its december gas contracts , and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout 2000 ( see daily gpi , june 30 ) . "" depending on what the gas prices are , and what our product prices are around the january - february time frame , we will make decisions then on our operations rate [ capacity ] , "" said melinda hood , a mississippi chemical spokeswoman . charles o . dunn , ceo of mississippi chemical , said , "" we remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers , but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times . it is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term , "" stated dunn . "" as a result , we felt it was in the company ' s best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices . going forward , we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices , nitrogen product prices and our customers ' requirements , as we have been doing for some time . "" international imports are also hurting u . s . producers . currently , there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market , which is holding ammonia prices down . u . s . fertilizer producers can ' t compete with the international market . gas prices are 46 cents / mmbtu in russia , 50 cents to $ 1 / mmbtu in argentina and venezuela , and $ 1 / mmbtu in trinidad . the u . s . imports 5 . 5 million tons of ammonia each year . fertilizers represent 80 % of the demand for ammonia in the united states . terra industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again - - - whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising , just as long as "" prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows . "" nyiri said he believes relief is in sight . he pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the $ 205 / ton level for the last several months , but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season . "" i ' ve got my model peaking out around $ 250 / ton in april or may and at that time i have gas costs coming down . "" at that point , the 1 - 2 bcf / d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin returning to service . - -",0

"ecml ' 98 tanlps workshop : first call for paper ecml-98 workshop : first call for papers ecml-98 workshop : towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata ) , italy since most of the applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems have still a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular changes in the domain , causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this klnowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research are methodological and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research enterprise , some issues can favour a sinergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowaday ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop is thus aiming to stimulate reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , a part from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second half of the day we expect to stimulate partecipants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , by a couple of invited talks on existing adaptive systems as a basis for presenting novel aspects on integration of nlp capabilities with learning from experience ( examples , errors , performance ) . a set of at least other 3 or 4 papers is expected to concentrate on original research works that we know are currently under development in several reasearch centres in europe ( sheffield university , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino university ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission - - whether hard copy or electronic - - a separate plain ascii text email message should be sent to roberto basili , containing the following information : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if attachments are submitted electronically ) # note : any relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper . . . . . . timetable : workshop announcement and call for papers : 5 january 1998 papers due : 15 february 1998 notification of acceptance : 5 march 1998 final version due : 25 march 1998 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it tel : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7391 fax : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7460 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",0

worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot

"wholes and their parts wholes and their parts ( w / p ) bolzano , maretsch castle , 17-19 june 1998 1 . presentation science is connected to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis . it may be said that classical physics is characterized by an in-built analysis of the world into constituent parts ( such as atoms or elementary particles ) . these are then recomposed together to provide , by means of synthesis , any system ; interactions are linearly and locally described ; the resulting hierarchy of structures is grounded on such constituent parts . in contemporary science , the age of "" pure "" analysis seems to have ended . there are deep mathematical reasons for this . non - linear systems have properties that , in general , cannot be expressed in terms of decomposition into ultimate , unstructured , pointlike parts plus a suitable sets of relations among them . moreover , the "" dialectic "" of quantity and quality is subtler than was previously thought and this dialectic is needed in the explanation of all sorts of phenomena . it arises not only in physics , but also in the study of cognitive systems and natural and programming languages . within psychology , it is said that "" gestalten "" are cohesive wholes and that "" the whole is more than the sum of its parts "" . but what does this mean exactly ? similar questions emerge in other contexts as well . what is relevant for the foundations of science , the need for a clear understanding of the part / whole relationships , emerges even in logic and mathematics , since these provide the tools for organizing our rational image of the world , in its multi-stratified complexity . thus , we are faced with the problem of relating in a possibly coherent way the various forms of part / whole relationships arising in different branches of science . we have not only to classify the different kinds of wholes and their inherent "" grammars "" , but also to take into account the process of formation for wholes , in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerges out of its parts and is irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous , more or less pointlike , entities . what makes ( in part , at least ) the difference between mere aggregates and cohesive wholes ? the members of the whole do not simply hang together : they hang together in the whole , and the structure of the whole influences the description of the parts and their local interactions . in view of the growing interest in this sort of pattern , of so deep relevance for theoretical and applied sciences , it is therefore suitable to clarify the whole / part issues in crucial fields of research , to compare different approaches and to develop a foundational discussion . 2 . program june 17 9 registration 10 bill lawvere , opening lecture 11 , 30 coffee break 12 john bell , w / p in algebraic and logical structures 13-15 lunch 15 ieke moerdjik , w / p in geometry , topology and topos theory 16 coffee break 16 , 30 colin mclarty , w / p in foundations of mathematics 17 , 30 carlo cellucci , w / p in logical analysis june 18 9 steve vickers , w / p in semantics for programming languages 10 gonzalo reyes , w / p in categorical analysis of language 11 coffee break 11 , 30 john mayberry , w / p in set theory 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 niles eldredge , w / p in biology 16 coffee break 16 , 30 alberto peruzzi , w / p in epistemology and semantics 17 , 30 roberto poli , w / p in ontology june 19 9 ettore casari , w / p in phenomenology 10 alf zimmer , w / p in gestalt psychology 11 coffee break 11 , 30 ron langacker , w / p in linguistics 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 george lakoff , w / p in cognitive sciences ( to be confirmed ) 16 coffee break 16 , 30 chris isham , w / p in quantum topology 17 , 30 basil hiley , w / p in mechanics and cosmology 3 . updates to keep you updated with more information on the conference this is the url for the w / p home page : http : / / www . gelso . unitn . it / ~ poli / 4 . registration fees registration fees only cover the participation in this conference . miscellaneous expenses ( accomodation , meals and social activities ) are in addition . the registration deadline to get the early registration fare is : march 1998 , 31st . students must enclose with the registration form a photocopy of their student card . status early registration ( before 3 / 31 / 98 ) late registration student 50 , 000 100 , 000 scholar 100 , 000 200 . 000 industrial 200 , 000 300 . 000 5 . accomodation participants should book their own accomodation . a selected hotel list is the following one : parkhotel laurin * * * * . 4 , laurinstrasse single-room and breakfast : 180 , 000-265 , 000 tel . + 39 471 31 10 00 , fax + 39 471 31 11 48 citta \ 146 * * * . 21 , waltherplatz single-room and breakfast : 110 , 000 tel . + 39 471 97 52 21 ;

"FLASH ALERT!
AIMSI Technologies, Inc. (AIMT) Banks $5 Million CASH;
Momentum
swells.
Dont Miss outRide the Wave!!!
See Press Release:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041124/245176_1.html
Growth Equity Corp. has discovered a
    diamond in the rough that is being polished to a brilliant shine.
Timing and Momentum are everything
! We believe 80%+ surge last week is just the
    prelude to AIMTs rise to the $6-$8 range in the next 60 days!!!
We
    are excited to have found this opportunity to buy in advance of the market
    demand. Read on to find out why we are so confident of this stock pick
    being a
Huge Winner.
(OTCBB:
AIMT
)
No Pump and Dump here. AIMSI
    Technologies Inc. (OTCBB:
AIMT
)
is a solid company with an exciting
    future.
In business over 10 years, profitable each
         year.
Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for
         the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM). A cutting edge
         technology patented by the
University
of
Alabama
at
Huntsville
,
that can detect radioactive dirty bombs,
         chemical and biological threats.
Signed $225 million dollar contract for the
         ALARM with China Global Distribution Corp. This contract alone
         should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to
AIMT,
and that's
just in
Asia
.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has
         a $44 billion dollar budget, and
AIMT
is well positioned to tap into this budget
         with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract.
ALARM units already in production, first
         units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in
Tennessee
.
CEO NEWS IS BEST OF ALL!
Savvy
    investors say this CEO MOVE is

stronger
than a garlic milkshake
.
Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has
    revised his employment agreement with the company. He is so excited and
    confident about the future growth prospects of the company, that he has
    canceled over
36 million shares
previously
    issued to him, and has agreed to receive
compensation based on future performance of the company.
See Press Release:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041119/195236_1.html
Since this represents more than half of
    the issued and outstanding shares of stock in the company, it won't take
    the market long to realize that the price per share should double in value.
That's good newsbut it gets
    better!
At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his
    stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split. The company felt
    that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price.
    (
Notwithstanding the
    company's intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock
    Exchange; AMEX
.
)
Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the outstanding
    shares have been reduced by 50%.
Press Release:
http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/041029/66580.html
This stock will
    not go unnoticed long. We predict this stock will soar to the $6.00 to
    $8.00 dollar/share range by the end of the year!!!

Timing
is perfect

The Homeland Security
    sector is hot.

Company
fundamentals are sound, with strong leadership.

Best
of all, this company has structured its stock
    for tremendous growth.

Lets say we have an nfs server with nfsd running really high load. nfsstat
will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access,

"new uci dissertations in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following two uci dissertations in linguistics . feature attraction and category movement brian k . agbayani university of california , irvine , 1998 this dissertation presents a new theory of movement in generative grammar within the framework of the minimalist program ( chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) . the most important aspect of the new theory is that it departs from the standard view of move a as a unitary operation . the dissertation has three main goals . the first goal is to simplify the theory of feature checking in such a way that a single structural configuration ( namely , the head-adjunction structure ) holds for feature checking in both overt and covert syntax . the second goal is to present evidence for the split movement hypothesis , according to which a set of formal features and its associated category move to separate structural positions in syntax . the claim is that ug makes both attract and move available in the form of attract f and category movement , respectively . the former satisfies the formal requirement of feature checking , and the latter yields the phonological "" displacement "" effect of overt movement . the theory thus abandons the treatment of move a as a unitary operation . the third goal is to explore consequences for the proper characterization of locality in syntax . the split movement approach opens up a novel way to account for the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects ( huang 1982a ) that do not fall under chomsky 's ( 1995 ) attract f theory . it is argued that attract f and category movement are subject to different types of economy conditions , and that the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects should not be given a unified account , contrary to the barriers approach ( chomsky 1986a ) . the theory also derives a number of previously mysterious properties related to cross linguistic variation in extractability out of islands , the relative strength of island effects , and the nature of successive-cyclic movement . this dissertation presents a new approach to movement in syntax which overcomes the conceptual and empirical shortcomings of the traditional approach , while gaining new insights into previously mysterious phenomena and properties of natural languages . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : parametrization of features in syntax sze - wing tang university of california , irvine , 1998 the major focus of this study is to propose a restrictive theory of parameters of universal grammar in terms of the principles-and - parameters approach . i propose that semantic features are invariant across languages ; only features that may play a role in the derivation from n to the pf interface level including phonetic features , categorial features , and affix features are subject to parametric variation , which is called the ' overt parametrization hypothesis ' ( oph ) . it is argued that where affix features are associated with a word is subject to parametric variation . movement is largely determined by morphology : movement in the overt component can be signaled by ' impoverished ' morphology ; movement of morphologically ' rich ' elements takes place in the phonological component . under this approach , a variety of syntactic differences among chinese ( cantonese and mandarin ) , english , french , japanese , navajo , and hebrew can be accounted for . based on the idea of parametrization of affix features , i claim that t has an affix feature [ - v ] in english . such an affix feature is missing in chinese . consequently , there is no v - to - t movement in chinese and v moves out of vp in english . a number of apparently disparate differences between these two languages , including postverbal no-phrases , the distribution of focus elements , binominal each , the ' sov ' focalization construction , scopal ambiguity of quantifiers , definiteness of preverbal numeral phrases , gapping , and heavy np shift , receive a unified explanation . the data presented as evidence for the claim that categorial features are subject to parametric variation are primarily based on small clauses in chinese , english , and japanese . it is argued that chinese small clauses are bare , english small clauses are ' not-so - bare ' , and japanese allows both types of small clauses . the major typological differences among these languages regarding the structure of small clauses are derived from a parameter related to the combination of categorial features of nouns and adjectives . the findings lend support to the oph . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement ikawa , hajime 1996 overt movement as a reflex of morphology ishii , toru 1997 an asymmetry in the composition of phrase structure and its consequences li , xiaoguang 1997 deriving distributivity in mandarin chinese takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : scrambling and partial object shift kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 4 ;

"accents : linguistnet in the news since victor raskin kindly kept me supplied with the responses he received to his july 6 query about the westfield accents petition , i was unusually well prepared to respond when a reporter meredith o'brien phoned me july 8 to ask if i had an opinion as a linguist on the matter ; when i told her about the linguistnet discussion of it , she was quite surprised and interested to learn of the existence of such a thing , and it turned out her ediotr was too , and the result was an article which is as much about linguistnet as about accents . the first such that i know of . i contacted victor to get his permission to use what i 'd gotten from him , but of course neither of us could contact quickly enough the many linguists whose responses i was faxing to the newspaper . i figured , and victor agreed , that messages sent to linguistnet are more or less public , and that in any case this was a very good and positive opportunity for us to do some educating of the public , which we are always looking for opportunities for . i certainly hope everyone who was quoted in the article agrees that i did the right thing in making the linguistnet discussion available to the reporter . i think the reporter did a good job of it . here 's the text of her article : springfield ( mass . ) union - news , westfield edition , friday , july 10 , 1992 , p . 1 linguists criticize accent position by meredith o'brien westfield - victor raskin , a linguistics professor at purdue university in indiana , was quite perplexed when he saw an article in his local newspaper about westfield 's petition to prohibit instructors with accents from teaching elementary school students . "" has anybody else seen a weird piece in the newspaper about a measure taken by the greek mayor of a small massachusetts town with a very ethnically mixed population to prevent people with foreign accents to be employed as grade school teachers , "" raskin asked subscribers to a linguistics computer network this week . "" besides killing my own chances of ever teaching grade school over there , is this measure nonsensical linguistically ? "" he queried . responses to raskin 's question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called "" linguistnet "" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee 's curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee 's attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition 's organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee 's decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into "" linguistnet "" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . "" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher "" , she said wednesday .

"contrastive linguistics and translation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - call for papers and participation symposium contrastive linguistics and translation studies empirical approaches universit catholique de louvain louvain - la - neuve , belgium 5 - 6 february , 1999 introduction over the last few years an important change has taken place in research into contrastive linguistics and translation studies . whereas previously both fields have drawn on largely introspective methodologies , most research is now conducted on large bodies of bilingual or multilingual data , a change which has had the important effect of providing the two disciplines with a much more solid empirical basis . many researchers are now working with computerised data , in many cases using specifically designed linguistic software tools to conduct automatic or semi-automatic analyses . bilingual concordancers are a case in point . research projects along these lines are becoming more widespread throughout the academic community and initial results are highly encouraging , revealing the enormous potential of computerised corpus analyses both for contrastive linguistics and translation studies . of course many researchers are still opting to use purely manual methods of analysis : indeed for many types of linguistic analysis ( semantic or discourse analysis for example ) , they will remain the only option for the foreseeable future . it is also notable that there are very few bilingual computer corpora available . for many therefore , the use of manual methods may not be a question of choice . this symposium is intended to bring together specialists in the fields of contrastive linguistics and translation studies conducting research on bilingual or multilingual corpora of any type . one important objective will be to demonstrate to what extent detailed corpus analysis can support , contradict or refine introspective contrastive analyses . another key aim is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of manual and automatic methods of data analysis . and lastly , the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity to exchange and share data , a step on the way to setting up an international multilingual databank available to everyone working in the field . symposium topics below is a non-exhaustive list of subject areas which we hope to address during the symposium : - contrastive lexicology ( in particular , contrastive phraseology ) - bilingual / multilingual lexicography - contrastive semantics - contrastive syntax - contrastive pragmatics - compiling and exploiting bilingual / multilingual computerised corpora - software tools for the analysis of bilingual corpora ( bilingual concordancing , automatic alignment , multilingual part-of - speech tagging , etc . ) - bilingual corpora and automatic / computer-aided translation languages english and french will be the two official symposium languages , with most papers given in english . symposium venue the symposium will take place in louvain - la - neuve , an entirely pedestrian university campus which , with its cafes , restaurants , shops , sports centre , cinema and theatre , offers all the advantages of a real town . 20 minutes away from brussels , it is easy to reach by car , train and plane , brussels national airport being within very easy reach . deadline for abstracts anyone wishing to present a paper at the symposium should send a one page abstract in electronic format ( preferably a word attachment ) to sylviane granger ( address below ) by 16 october 1998 at the latest . notification of acceptance will be given by 6 november 1998 . payment the cost of the symposium is as follows : - before 30 november 1998 : 2500 belgian francs - after 30 november 1998 : 3500 belgian francs this includes the symposium fee , the book of abstracts , coffee breaks and lunch on both days . accommodation two types of accommodation are on offer : - chambre la rsidence universitaire ( le relais , rue de la gare 6 , 1348 louvain - la - neuve ) : 1600 fb par nuit , petit djeuner inclus ;

red hat release, and the next beta isn't out yet. Since the beta is out
now, gnomehide won't be updated again for a while.Julian

"change of control provisions as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million . many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision . i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry . thank you .",0

"affricates - - one segment or two the recent query and summary by larry trask on german affricates makes me think of the fact that , unless i am mistaken , it is perfectly easy to hear the difference between one - and two-segment stop-fricative sequences at least in some cases . polish has a contrast of this sort at least in initial position , where the words spelled _ trzy _ and _ czy _ differ only in that the former has a cluster , the second an affricate . also , if you compare the english way of saying _ ts _ with the german way of saying _ z _ ( or the polish or the yiddish , etc . ) , there is an audible difference . most english speakers ' rendition of _ matzah _ ( or _ matzoh _ ) for example sounds quite different from the yiddish or polish , but ( and this is also very suggestive ) i have found a few am . engl . speakers ( not all of them jewish , by the way ) who have the affricate , i . e . , one-segment / ts / in this and perhaps some other yiddish borrowings but the two segment / t / + / s / otherwise , so that these speakers do not rhyme _ matzah _ and _ lots o ( f ) _ , whereas most speakers do . finally , i think some speakers have a one-segment / ts / in hit ya , but a two-segment / t / + / s / in hits ya , although most speakers i have asked refuse to admit anything but the nonpalatalized , non-affricated pronunciation in the second case . alexis mr",0

work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.> Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few

is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.> That means that we might have a system that is less than 100%

> (Complex

not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.> Perhaps Craig is just theorizing, but I just thought I'd offer my two

quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.C-------------------------------------------------------

Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java, please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of October). There will be a technical and writing test, and interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with others.This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.=================================== * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 ImminentThe second revision will be up on the site soon, at: http://64.78.49.204/The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the beginning of the book.The book is due at the end of October.

More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings.United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal , a Information-Communication Technology Policy Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector.This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source, e-Government and related fields.Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.See http://www.egovos.org/OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N. ======================Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin of the Information Society Division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science and culture.It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said Dauphin. Check out the sites atUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/) UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/) UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/) UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS ======================Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code (GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtmlMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and related issues.""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid Akhtar told this correspondent.Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects; GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries.CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS ======================In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's the message that governments across India were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector.On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news.GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater . While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95< according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led organizations that LINC serves. ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC explains.LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local support.""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said Slater.To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC Project Linux pages at NEED TO NETWORK ===============Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it. Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community. ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds. -- Frederick Noronha * Freelance Journalist * Goa * India 832.409490 / 409783 BYTESFORALL www.bytesforall.org * GNU-LINUX http://linuxinindia.pitas.com Email fred@bytesforall.org * Mobile +9822 122436 (Goa) * Saligao Goa India Writing with a difference... on what makes *the* difference ########################################################################## # Send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: cola@stump.algebra.com # # PLEASE remember a short description of the software and the LOCATION. # # This group is archived at http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/ # ########################################################################## ------------------------------From: Frederick Noronha Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative] Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMTDear friends,Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.Jeebesh Bagchi sent in this offer recently. It could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ==========The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi (www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of SoftwareSarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs.

grokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was
the propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not
in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.
He listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the
author meant to come off at the point that you seem to be
conjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly
didn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not
include some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an
earlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.GLM> Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and

GLM> one carried the ""infection"" the ""plague"" (note, not the ""antigen"" or
GLM> the ""hormone"", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,
GLM> but they chose the fear-charged words)This article never got into the bones & blood of what humans are Gary.
  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.
I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.
That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about
those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how
the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a
psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who
fantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into
that distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because
you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're
going to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle
game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from
the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that
moment.GLM> ""Make no mistake about it"" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate
GLM> it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to
GLM> /excuse/ ""our"" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'
GLM> ourselves of ""them"", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its
GLM> hate.
I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where
you saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.
I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he
meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common
father with a football complex dream) he should have included our
delusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you
get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)
objects... ?GLM> What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  Lots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad.  :)GLM> Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour
GLM> are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact
GLM> more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+
people.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into
perspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a
whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_
much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and
organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on
the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your
children with Jesus, but its not equivalent.The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed
people.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While
the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label
can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different
effects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?
Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry?GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
GLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
GLM> planet?  They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly
one.GLM> What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
GLM> our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
GLM> trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
GLM> it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
GLM> /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
GLM> and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?GLM> When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
GLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No
questions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I
think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are
folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about
the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the
made-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or
protections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over
others.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy
that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very
clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,
Gary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.
I won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but
I'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.GLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I
GLM> understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.Too bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies
of people, yours or others.

> availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competitionI think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.IMHO, as always...
- Matthew[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as ""they need to
make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.__________________________________________________

"deal confirmation changes good afternoon ron , we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system . currently , the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real - time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups . one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes . this solution will not work . if the real - time guys start changing the deals in deal entry , the original negotiated deal will be lost . also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing . thanks , david poston it manager , portland",0

' s ( ene ) financial dealings , it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target . but speculation has been persistent that royal dutch / shell group may use enron ' s weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover . over the weekend , the british newspaper , the independent , fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that shell was expected to offer $ 11 billion for the houston energy trader . a shell spokesman wasn ' t immediately available . surely , enron ' s thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the anglo - dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the u . s . natural gas market , where shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence . however , a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company ' s financial structure . enroll has used a web of off - balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs . some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet . several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending . as for enron ' s core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enron ' s staff . as a result , it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions . shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its coral energy unit , and the acquisition of enron could give it instant clout in the market . also , shell ' s strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness . traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of enron ' s business are uncovered . a growth - fund manager , who requested anonymity , also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in enron ' s stock price . he speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock . enron shares recently traded at $ 11 . 14 , down 16 cents , or 1 . 4 % . the stock began the day in positive territory , and traded as high as $ 12 . 20 intraday . the stock has declined more than 60 % since the company in mid - october posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow . in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded by moody ' s investor service , standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street , main street and the oil patch . norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg , before he sold it at a huge profit . this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco , a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing , it is wallowing in it . blake has general electric training . this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away . where was he in all of this ? stuck in comdisco hell ? ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong , a place where financial originality is always on display . chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared . he ' s seen everything over in kong . john duncan is an energy investment guy , a director of eott energy , and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting . again , very sophisticated . wendy gramm regulated derivatives . she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange . how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed ? that was part of her old job . robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school , where he was also dean . this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming . ( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . ) charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me . paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ? frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments . jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ? john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart . herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations . in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing . i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were . still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing . which is pretty terrible in its own right . this market deserves your well - placed optimism by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 05 / 2001 10 : 32 am est url : > d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it . heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying . i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun . or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these . turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right . that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 . we get so caught up in the "" is cisco bottoming ? "" or "" is intel breaking out ? "" minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago . you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn . don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 . and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding . but that doesn ' t make me bearish . understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been "" bought in "" on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again . believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing "" unpatriotic "" about saying "" get out now . "" but i don ' t think that ' s right . i think this market ' s going to keep working here . if it doesn ' t , people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me , and i will say , c ' est la vie , i took a stand ; it was wrong . taking stands , however , is what it is all about . knowing your context and making money with that context is what i do and have done for 20 years . if you don ' t have a context , if you don ' t have a view , there ' s only one thing to do : give your money to others who do . random musings : glenn curtis ' s era of value newsletter has been making me money . when something makes me money i talk about it . check it out here . curtis and gary b . smith both are doing some terrific things . understand , i get all of the newsletters out there . i see the hype that a navallier or a murphy puts out and i want to puke . this stuff is nothing like that , nothing at all . it is honest , candid and doesn ' t guarantee that you will shoot the lights out , like those who you know can ' t . . . on my radio show , it ' s mutual fund monday , where we will fix your 401 ( k ) ) . call me at 1 - 800 - 862 - 8686 from 3 p . m . to 4 p . m . et .",0

"Brian O'Donoghue asked:
> > Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding

> It would?Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy
chocolate flavoured pieces... :)Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)- Matthew[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)

administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
18.851s).However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.> If you're desparate to save memory, write a subclass?That's probably what I'll do if I get too antsy :)Trying to think of ways to sneak ""administrative pickle boat"" into

Date: 2002-09-23T23:21:12-06:00Finally finished up (most of) TRAMP, my RDF interface for Python. (If you don't 
use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  _But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
if you're not already convinced.    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same 
    time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tramp

"a practical matter, I doubt the value sold in such situations ever adds up to the value lost. And the non-pecuiary since of violation, loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this situation. We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.I'm not a lawyer either. I played one on TV once but I didn't play a very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's 'Takings'. He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my libertarian theology needed to be modified.He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.> -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of > Russell Turpin > Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 2:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money! > > John Hall: > >The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is > >often far less than the value to the victim.

a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also

"Gary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

Music school jokes --American conductor and European conductor are talking.  European conductor 
says ""what a week, I've had 5 rehearsals and a performance.""  ""That's 
nothing,"" says the American conductor, ""I've had five performances and a 
rehearsal.""  What's the difference between a spring in the desert surrounded by palm 
trees and a violist that plays in tune?  A violist that plays in tune is a 
mirage.What's the difference between a rat and a guitar player?  The rat's got 
something to do tonight.Good thing it's not comedy school.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. 
Keep the bad guys
out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: 
ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends
your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. 
Click here to download now!   As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a startling revelation that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clarkhttp://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Sorting IP Addresses Via Script
http://www.i386.com/Default.asp?page=docs/scripting-ip2long.htm&category=admin&id=1046
Documentation is everything. If you have a handle on your 
network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP 
addresses are one bit of information that must be properly 
tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort 
data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief 
article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, 
perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted 
decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided 
to get you started.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown
http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html
Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?Virtual Sketching

I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box

( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it 's different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it 's especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that 's because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i ' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really 's now ' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ? ( the members are , technically speaking , separate lexemes since partly idiosyncratic morphological changes mark the verbal forms , and must therefore be listed separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson 's dictionary does . ) ( d ) following jacobson , i ' ve specially labelled those lexemes that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speaking region . are you going to try to make counts for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so .

">>>>> ""O"" == Owen Byrne  writes:    O> From the local paper this morning.  ""Canadians eat about seven
    O> times as many doughnuts per capita""... (as Americans) . D'oh!If we had more variety of franchise food than the
Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly (they are all Pepsi
under the hood, aren't they?), things might be different.  When a New
Yorker has biscotti, we have a timbit, when a Parisienne has a
croissant, we have a timbit ... because that's all we can buy.The USA is a nation founded on creative free enterprise entrepreneurs;
Canada is a nation built on monopolies.--

"[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically
 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the
record, here's how it all works:  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any ""junk mail
    condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as
    ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
    ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected
    after the message headers/body are read).    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
    are:
      - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
        verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"",
        and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
        lookups timeout)  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This
    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message.    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is
    retained in saved messages.)    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is
    basically this:
      if virus:
          folder = ""virus""
      else:
          run through SpamAssassin
          if score >= 10.0:
              folder = ""rejected-spam""
          elif score >= 5.0:
              folder = ""caught-spam""    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
    By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles
    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to
    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,
    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called
    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB
    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When
    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body.    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This
    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
    detectors.  Tim?Happy harvesting --        Greg

"comparative method in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and "" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world "" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this "" because the cut-off point is so shallow "" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .",0

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, 
Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such 
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you 
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your 
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had 
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving 
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like 
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being 
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited 
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an 
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field 
back in my Marine Corps days. As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the 
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink 
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of 
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An 
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, 
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been 
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. 
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it 
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from 
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on 
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a 
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly 
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of 
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Exchange Titanium Details Emerge
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp
Oracle recently announced their intention to compete 
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as 
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're 
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. 
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly 
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all 
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be 
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control 
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being 
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot 
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. 
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they 
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for 
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencerhttp://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html
An open source project is bringing a different spin to 
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... 
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe 
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct 
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio 
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, 
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds 
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a 
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and 
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are 
supported, so you should be able to find something 
appropriate to your device.

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html
Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, 
and it's something you should probably know about if you use 
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine 
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the 
Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to 
distribute their implementation via the web, though 
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. 
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. 
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft 
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all 
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still 
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. 
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is 
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this 
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP 
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their 
own distibution.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugashttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P
I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of 
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared 
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check 
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and 
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory 
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for 
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. 
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which 
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're 
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines. Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020717.html

"asl dictionary on cd-rom my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english "" lecture "" is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu",0

"aaas what follows are the minutes of the meeting of section z - linguistics and the language science - - held during the atlanta aaas annual meeting . the section committee hopes that this will be of interest to all linguists and once again urges any linguist not yet a member of aaas to join and select section z as their priary affiliation . ( a membership form follows the minutes ) v . fromkin , section z , secretary = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = section z - - linguistics & the language sciences section meeting - february 17 , 1995 , 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 pm marriott marquis , atlanta , ga . minutes attendance : retiring chair barbara lust , chair , richie kayne , chair - elect stephen anderson , chair elect 1995 sarah thomason , secretary , vicki fromkin , members of steering committee : paul chapin , ilse lehiste , paul chapin , section z representative to aaas council , arnold zwicky , and 10-25 individuals ( 20 signed the attendance sheet ) . ( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized . ( note that these are not necessarily the titles of the symposia to be submitted but rather signify the contents we would like to see presented . ) ( the name in parenthesis after each is the person designated to contact the proposed organizers ) i . language in the schools . proposed organizers wayne o neil , maya honda , walt wolfram ( wayne o neil ) ii . new technology ( e . g . mri , ct , pet ) in the study of the biology of language . proposed organizer : david caplan ( v . fromkin ) iii . the structure and acquisition of sign languages . proposed organizer : ursula bellugi ( v . fromkin ) iv . child language acquisition . proposed organizer : lila gleitman ( v . fromkin ) v : connectionism vs . symbolic systems models of cognition . proposed organizer : paul smolensky ( steve anderson ) ( following the meeting some of the members of the section steering committee proposed that geoffrey nunberg also be asked to submit a proposal on prescriptivism / the equality of dialects / english only legislation or such related issues . fromkin and anderson will contact him ) barbara lust informed the section that we also received a tentative idea for a possible symposium from lisa menn ( working with both lsa and asha ) which would be on theoretical , modeling and therapeutic studies of the acquisition of phonology . this was referred to sharon goldsmith of asha for further consideration for their support . ( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science .",0

I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users.  It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things.

"henwood stuff and thoughts about valuation did you guys get this ? i was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about risk / return if the decision would be covered in rates , it is the customers ' curves or equivalently the puc ' s curve . i think if i were going to approach valuation in commodities where the assumptions of black / scholes do not apply , i would start with the capm for large industries in an area , use pro formas to translate this to utility curves for the input commodities , and add the utility curves . another issue : the factor that explains why enron is lowest bidder is its role in the market . in the 1930 s , keynes argued that if most market participants with long position were hedgers , futures prices would be higher than spot ; if they were speculators or traders , future prices would be lower than spot . traders must be compensated for holding the risk ; hedgers ( including utilities and consumers ) are willing to pay a premium for the certainty . consequently , enron traders have bigger bid / ask spreads and lower bid prices . just some random thoughts , michael - - - - - original message - - - - - date : 01 / 04 / 2001 10 : 41 am ( thursday ) from : "" heather mason "" to : hq 3 . em 5 ( michael schilmoeller ) mark your calendar - tuesday january 23 , 2001 downtown houston hyatt hotel henwood will be hosting a comprehensive ercot symposium on tuesday , january 23 , 2001 . a team of henwood regional power market specialists will be presenting the latest analysis and information to assist you in preparing for the new ercot restructured power market , in addition to an anlysis of the issues now playing out in the wscc markets . coffee and registration will begin at 9 : 30 am and the program will run until 3 : 00 pm . lunch and snacks will be provided . agenda topics include : * what will be the critical - success factors for qualified scheduling entities operating in ercot ' s new wholesale & retail markets ? * how will market restructuring impact mid to long - term wholesale prices ? * what is the outlook for new generation ? * what are the impacts of upcoming emission regulations on ercot ' s generation resources ? * what are the new analytical tools available to capture market uncertainty impacts to your supply contracts and generation assets ? * what are the restructuring lessons learned from the california experience and the implications to ercot ? in conjunction with this program , henwood will have a demonstration room available to present its latest software applications and e - business solutions . a nominal $ 75 registration fee is required to reserve a space in the workshop . for more information or to reserve your spot , please contact heather mason at henwood : hmason @ hesinet . com or 916 / 569 - 0985 . about henwood : henwood offers integrated business solutions , strategic consulting , and innovative e - business applications to meet the challenges of the restructured energy markets throughout north america , australia , and europe , serving clients that include eight of the ten top utilities in north america , in addition to energy services providers and power marketers .",0

"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:Application       What gets pastedXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwrittenThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??--

"organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and operational services in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit , enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production corporation ( nepco ) . brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under john gillis , president . with the majority of ee & cc and oec ' s activities focused on assets and projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports . this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units which they support . with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design , construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron ' s assets on a global basis . this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world . please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments . mark frevert & dave delainey",0

"re : 6 . 100 sum : ipa history & haceks , stemberger suggests that north american linguists who use haceks are following a tradition which is just as international as that of the international phonetic association , which he labels a western european organization . even a cursory glance at the ipa membership list would have shown him that the ipa is an international body , with many north american members . it is governed by an elected council , with over half the members coming from outside western europe , several of the council being from the united states , others from eastern europe ( poland and russia ) , and others from china , japan , australia , finland , south africa , and nigeria . it is the north american linguists who use diverse symbols who are not following truly international conventions . having said that , let me say that i happen to agree with him that it would be appropriate to use haceks for palato-alveolar sounds . the hacek would then be a diacritic marking a natural class of sounds . i proposed this at the 1989 kiel convention of the ipa , but i was voted down by my more conservative colleagues , who consider it important to keep the ipa as stable as possible . i see their point of view , but prefer mine . nevertheless there is no point in having democratically approved international standards unless one keeps to them , so i will reluctantly avoid haceks . peter ladefoged",0

"metals - imminent actions - an update rick / rick / sally i attach the ' executive ' summary of a note sent to the office of the chair last week detailing current operational difficulties with the metals merchanting business . subsequently an ' all hands ' meeting was called to discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of off balance sheet facility ( "" obsf "" ) renegotiation minimising working captial sap implementation the notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email should you require any further information please call , otherwise i will forward updates as they are completed . regards mike issue the physical metals business implemented an off balance sheet structure ( obsf ) pre year - end to meet enron requirements for gearing ratios . whilst this does not present undue problems for lme warrants , these being bearer documents , it does present an issue when physical metal , the value of which depends upon brand and location , is placed into the facility . given the hard deadline of year - end the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets . the impact of the obsf on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated . the process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements , particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the as 400 . with the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from obsf can be managed satisfactorily . the core functionality , which was due prior to the year - end , was released during january but was subsequently found to have introduced  + bugs  , to the integrated business control processes . whilst an improvement on having no obsf functionality , the  + bugs  , have had an increasingly negative effect on the control environment , compounded by the fact that it can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the  + bug  , fixes and non core  , reporting  , functionality . this has given rise to the following concerns : ? there are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a brand & location level to coordination records ( the global position is reconciled however ) . ? it is not possible to substantiate the dpr for em & cl as : ? a ) p & l on spread moves from cash to 3 months positions ( and related cash to 3 months provisions ) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated , and ? b ) system bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values . these concerns are compounded by the following : ? the most experienced as 400 it developer for the em & cl business has resigned . he is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in july 2001 . ? the most experienced as 400 it developer on the eml side of the business has also resigned . he left in january 2001 . ? there is no documentation for the as 400 . it is therefore difficult for experienced as 400 programmers to get upto speed on the system . conclusion it is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the as 400 system and the renegotiation of the obsf facility with barclays . the current situation has arisen due to non - delivery of it developments and tight timescales on the finalisation of the obsf facility . to meet ql end requirements ( i . e . full production of the dpr and stock reconciliation ) , it and the obsf deal team must make concrete commitments on delivery timeline . the business will not be able to commit to successful implementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the trial balance without these - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 26 / 02 / 2001 16 : 18 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mike jordan 26 / 02 / 2001 16 : 18 to : michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , michael farmer / eu / enron @ enron , michael j hutchinson / eu / enron @ enron , anne edgley / lon / ect @ ect , melissa allen / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , paul chivers / lon / ect @ ect , robert campbell / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , howard carter / eu / enron @ enron , bill appleby / lon / ect @ ect , david p tregar / eu / enron @ enron cc : subject : metals - imminent actions - notes of meeting 23 rd feb to all i seek to clarify the actions discussed at friday ' s meeting and to emphasise the critical importance of getting all the below completed as quickly as possible to meet our ql requirements ( revenue targets , balance sheet targets , interest expense minimisation etc ) . the proposed tactical plan that was circulated is not attached as it has already been superceded ! there was agreement on several broad areas of immediate focus with specific objectives and accountabilities - it resourcing communicate priority to hr about the importance of obtaining skilled as 400 programmers - for tactical short term and for long term work - action mp resourcing for long term as 400 ' off - load ' initiative to be completed asap - action mp merchanting resource focus to be on bug fixes impacting mo ability to update obsf options in as 400 and for traffic to update recent location movements of stock in obsf - action rc ( deadline 1 week ) completion of inception document for full obsf inventory control functionality - action rc ( deadline 1 week ) split of resources for sap interface - only eml sap implementation is now planned for 1 / 4 / 01 - action rc to confirm resource reallocation 27 / 01 immediate improvement in it operations support required ( including completion of transfer of support responsibility from dev . to ops . ) - action mp operational support mo risk / trade accounting resources to focus on rebooking all remaining transactions on obsf inventory spreadsheet - action hc ( deadline asap ) validation of system generated p & l to commence following the above - action hc ( deadline asap ) timetable for catch up of traffic obsf location movements to be completed with john lunzer 27 / 02 - action hc determine action for improvement in delivering metal to facility ( initial assumption for recent working capital increase was that we had operationally slowed down in placing qualifying material into facility ) - action hc / ac ( deadline asap ) working capital detailed daily analysis of working capital movements to be produced and formatted in style of sources and uses of funds ( including facility headroom ) - action ac ( deadline asap ) forward estimate of working capital to be produced for rest of quarter and used for estimation of full interest expense - action ac , mj & ma ( deadline asap ) analysis for trade receivables ( and reasons for recent increase ) and investigation of possible factoring - ac / mj and ae / ba ( deadline asap ) determining extent to which pricing signals for working capital usage can be communicated to traders , traffic and operations - action jg , mj ( contingent on above ) obsf negotiation documentation of current negotiation issues ( including aa sign - off issues ) to be drafted and circulated with clear accountabilities - action ma / dt / ba ( deadline 26 / 3 ) operational impact of agreement to be considered in parallel to negotiation - action hc / ac / ba lme relationship consider utilising a us subsidiary to book obsf transactions to negate lme reviewing facility as part of regulatory regime - action ma / fd monitoring notice of investigation issued by lme - action fd / dt",0

"re : var for credit trading ted thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance , i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context . i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr . however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this is being done ) i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately . finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible . i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface issues with you next week regards mike from : ted murphy 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 50 to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried cc : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : var for credit trading please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails . the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to . it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable . obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one at a time . ted oliver gaylard 06 / 26 / 2000 08 : 34 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on this . oliver from : david port @ enron 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 24 to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the board approved the limit . dp chris abel @ ect 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 41 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chris abel / hou / ect on 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 38 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary thambiah 06 / 23 / 2000 03 : 29 am to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading hi chris i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries feel free to give him a call . rgds mary",0
"zellig harris last thursday night , may 21 , zellig harris died in his sleep after a pleasant working day . he was 88 years old . he was born in 1904 in byelorussia . i am told that he chose the name zellig sabbettai when his family immigrated to the united states when he was four . i like to think that the semantics of happiness and steadfastness were on his mind . certainly they were keynotes of his life . i would guess that his parents chose the name harris . when he died , he was just finishing a book on politics that he had been planning for most of his life . with the 1992 publication of his book _ a theory of language and information _ ( oxford ) , he had wrapped up his life 's work on language , at least for the time being . he seems to have felt at liberty to take up this other unfinished business . i understand from paul mattick , jr . , who was harris 's friend and neighbor for many years in new york , that this last book describes how to get from capitalism to socialism . this is surely not a conventional take on either capitalism or socialism , harris was an anarchist . oxford was interested in publishing it , and he had also talked with cambridge . there is no memorial planned , beyond something very private for his family . however , there is some discussion beginning of a public meeting with scientific content . i would hope that the festschrift that haj ross called for in the lsa meetings some years ago might at last come into being . harris described himself as a methodologist rather than a linguist . this could be misleading . he always said that his work was not part of linguistics as it is institutionally defined , and that linguists would not be interested in his work , though people interested in language would be . nonetheless , he was surely a linguist by most of the operational definitions one might come up with . he had done extensive fieldwork on a variety of language . when he was doing the final revision of the 1992 oxford book , he undertook to test the theory of language against every language of which he had some control , 44 languages . he spent months reading grammars from morning to night , and evaluating whether his theory had a reasonable account for what he found there . he was clear that no scientific conclusions were warranted , and so no particular notice of this check is given in the book , but he wanted to feel reasonably secure that his conclusions were not idiosyncratic to english , french , german , korean , and the few other languages that had been the primary bases for their development . he was pleased with the results . his contributions to the field were numerous and weighty . he founded the first linguistics department in the u . s . he introduced the algebraic representations and abstract mathematical treatment which have become so much norms of the field that it is difficult now to appreciate how much he did so over the kicking and screaming protests of his peers . he invented x - bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi 's tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris 's approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out "" i ' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john 's class . "" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on "" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase "" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n't invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n't accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won't be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) "" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . "" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said "" descriptive "" but the publisher substituted the buzzword "" structural . "" i recall him saying , amusedly , "" i do n't remember whether they asked me or not . "" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky 's followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n't think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the "" transformational revolution . "" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris "" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , "" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky 's ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley 's review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris 's operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris 's work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris 's grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like "" someone was opposed by everyone . "" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris 's selected writings , asked "" why bother ? "" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris 's program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris 's work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley 's witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris 's intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the "" constructional procedure "" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one 's control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) "" he did n't really mean that . "" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris 's later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the "" background vernacular "" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i ' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one 's biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in "" why phonology is n't natural . "" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris 's endeavor was always , then , to determine a "" least grammar , "" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists ' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein 's assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life 's work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying "" ok , i ' m ready now . "" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com",0

"The Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.--j.
